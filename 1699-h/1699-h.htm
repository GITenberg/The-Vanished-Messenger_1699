    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were very few people upon Platform Number Twenty-one of Liverpool
      Street Station at a quarter to nine on the evening of April 2&mdash;possibly
      because the platform in question is one of the most remote and least used
      in the great terminus. The station-master, however, was there himself,
      with an inspector in attendance. A dark, thick-set man, wearing a long
      travelling ulster and a Homburg hat, and carrying in his hand a brown
      leather dressing-case, across which was painted in black letters the name
      MR. JOHN P. DUNSTER, was standing a few yards away, smoking a long cigar,
      and, to all appearance absorbed in studying the advertisements which
      decorated the grimy wall on the other side of the single track. A couple
      of porters were seated upon a barrow which contained one solitary
      portmanteau. There were no signs of other passengers, no other luggage. As
      a matter of fact, according to the time-table, no train was due to leave
      the station or to arrive at it, on this particular platform, for several
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down at the other end of the platform the wooden barrier was thrust back,
      and a porter with some luggage upon a barrow made his noisy approach. He
      was followed by a tall young man in a grey tweed suit and a straw hat on
      which were the colours of a famous cricket club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector watched them curiously. &ldquo;Lost his way, I should think,&rdquo; he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station-master nodded. &ldquo;It looks like the young man who missed the
      boat train,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Perhaps he has come to beg a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man in question made steady progress up the platform. His hands
      were thrust deep into the pockets of his coat, and his forehead was
      contracted in a frown. As he approached more closely, he singled out Mr.
      John P. Dunster, and motioning his porter to wait, crossed to the edge of
      the track and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to you for a moment, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster turned at once and faced his questioner. He did so
      without haste&mdash;with a certain deliberation, in fact&mdash;yet his
      eyes were suddenly bright and keen. He was neatly dressed, with the quiet
      precision which seems as a rule to characterise the travelling American.
      He was apparently of a little less than middle-age, clean-shaven,
      broad-shouldered, with every appearance of physical strength. He seemed
      like a man on wires, a man on the alert, likely to miss nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Mr. John P. Dunster?&rdquo; the youth asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carry my visiting-card in my hand, sir,&rdquo; the other replied, swinging
      his dressing-case around. &ldquo;My name is John P. Dunster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s expression was scarcely ingratiating. To a natural
      sullenness was added now the nervous distaste of one who approaches a
      disagreeable task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want, if I may, to ask you a favour,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel
      like granting it, please say no and I&rsquo;ll be off at once. I am on my way to
      The Hague. I was to have gone by the boat train which left half an hour
      ago. I had taken a seat, and they assured me that the train would not
      leave for at least ten minutes, as the mails weren&rsquo;t in. I went down the
      platform to buy some papers and stood talking for a moment or two with a
      man whom I know. I suppose I must have been longer than I thought, or they
      must have been quicker than they expected with the mailbags. Anyhow, when
      I came back the train was moving. They would not let me jump in. I could
      have done it easily, but that fool of an inspector over there held me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very strict in this country, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster agreed, without change of expression. &ldquo;Please go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you arrive&mdash;just too late for the train. While I was swearing
      at the inspector, I heard you speak to the station-master. Since then I
      have made inquiries. I understand that you have ordered a special train to
      Harwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster said nothing, only his keen, clear eyes seemed all the
      time to be questioning this gloomy-looking but apparently harmless young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the station-master&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; the latter continued, &ldquo;and tried
      to persuade them to let me ride in the guard&rsquo;s van of your special, but he
      made a stupid fuss about it, so I thought I&rsquo;d better come to you. Can I
      beg a seat in your compartment, or anywhere in the train, as far as
      Harwich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster avoided, for the moment, a direct reply. He had the air of a
      man who, whether reasonably or unreasonably, disliked the request which
      had been made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are particularly anxious to cross to-night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the youth admitted emphatically. &ldquo;I never ought to have risked
      missing the train. I am due at The Hague to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster moved his position a little. The light from a
      rain-splashed gas lamp shone now full upon the face of his suppliant: a
      boy&rsquo;s face, which would have been pleasant and even handsome but for the
      discontented mouth, the lowering forehead, and a shadow in the eyes, as
      though, boy though he certainly was in years, he had already, at some time
      or another, looked upon the serious things of life. His nervousness, too,
      was almost grotesque. He had the air of disliking immensely this asking a
      favour from a stranger. Mr. Dunster appreciated all these things, but
      there were reasons which made him slow in granting the young man&rsquo;s
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the nature of your pressing business at The Hague?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;that you will not think it of much
      importance. I am on my way to play in a golf tournament there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A golf tournament at The Hague!&rdquo; Mr. Dunster repeated, in a slightly
      altered tone. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster stood quite still for a moment. He was possessed of a
      wonderful memory, and he was conscious at that moment of a subtle appeal
      to it. Fentolin! There was something in the name which seemed to him
      somehow associated with the things against which he was on guard. He stood
      with puzzled frown, reminiscent for several minutes, unsuccessful. Then he
      suddenly smiled, and moving underneath the gas lamp, shook open an evening
      paper which he had been carrying. He turned over the pages until he
      arrived at the sporting items. Here, in almost the first paragraph, he saw
      the name which had happened to catch his eye a moment or two before:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     GOLF AT THE HAGUE

    Among the entrants for the tournament which commences
    to-morrow, are several well-known English players,
    including Mr. Barwin, Mr. Parrott, Mr. Hillard and
    Mr. Gerald Fentolin.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster folded up the newspaper and replaced it in his pocket. He
      turned towards the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a golfer, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I play a bit,&rdquo; was the somewhat indifferent reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster turned to another part of the paper and pointed to the great
      black head-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems a queer thing for a young fellow like you to be worrying about
      games,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been in this country more than a few
      hours, but I expected to find all the young men getting ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting ready for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to fight, of course,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster replied. &ldquo;Seems pretty clear that
      there&rsquo;s an expeditionary force being fitted out, according to this
      evening&rsquo;s paper, somewhere up in the North Sea. The only Englishman I&rsquo;ve
      spoken to on this side was willing to lay me odds that war would be
      declared within a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s lack of interest was curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the army,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t affect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive my curiosity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but say, is there nothing you
      could get into and fight if this thing came along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, that I know of,&rdquo; the youth replied coolly. &ldquo;War is an
      affair which concerns only the military and naval part of two countries.
      The civil population&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plays golf, I suppose,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster interrupted. &ldquo;Young man, I haven&rsquo;t
      been in England for some years, and you rather take my breath away. All
      the same, you can come along with me as far as Harwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man showed signs of some satisfaction. &ldquo;I am very much obliged
      to you, sir,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I promise you I won&rsquo;t be in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The station-master, who had been looking through a little pile of
      telegrams brought to him by a clerk from his office, now turned towards
      them. His expression was a little grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your special will be backing down directly, sir,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;but I am
      sorry to say that we hear very bad accounts of the line. They say that
      this is only the fag-end of the storm that we are getting here, and that
      it&rsquo;s been raging for nearly twenty-four hours on the east coast. I doubt
      whether the Harwich boat will be able to put off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take our chance about that,&rdquo; Dunster remarked. &ldquo;If the mail boat
      doesn&rsquo;t run, I presume there will be something else we can charter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The station-master looked the curiosity which he did not actually express
      in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money will buy most things, nowadays, sir,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;but if it isn&rsquo;t
      fit for our mail boat, it certainly isn&rsquo;t fit for anything else that can
      come into Harwich Harbour. However, you&rsquo;ll hear what they say when you get
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster nodded and relapsed into a taciturnity which was obviously one
      of his peculiarities. The young man strolled down the platform, and
      catching up with the inspector, touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who the fellow is?&rdquo; he asked curiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully decent
      of him to let me go with him, but he didn&rsquo;t seem very keen about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inspector shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He drove up just two minutes after the train
      had gone, came straight into the office and ordered a special. Paid for
      it, too, in Bank of England notes before he went out. I fancy he&rsquo;s an
      American, and he gave his name as John P. Dunster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused to light a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s an American, I suppose that accounts for it,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;He
      must be in a precious hurry to get somewhere, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A night like this, too!&rdquo; the inspector remarked, with a shiver. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t leave London myself unless I had to. They say there&rsquo;s a
      tremendous storm blowing on the east coast. Here comes the train, sir&mdash;just
      one saloon and the guard&rsquo;s van.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little train backed slowly along the platform side. The engine was
      splashed with mud and soaking wet. The faces of the engine-driver and his
      companion shone from the dripping rain. The station-master held open the
      door of the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a rough journey before you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch the boat
      all right, though&mdash;if it goes. The mail train was very heavy
      to-night. You should catch her up this side of Colchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am taking this young gentleman with me,&rdquo; he announced shortly. &ldquo;It
      seems that he, too, missed the train. I am much obliged to you,
      station-master, for your attention. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were about to start when Mr. Dunster once more let down the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as it is such a wild night, you will oblige me
      very much if you will tell the engine-driver that there will be a five
      pound note for himself and his companion if we catch the mail. Inspector!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inspector touched his hat. The station-master had turned discreetly
      away. He had been an inspector himself once, and sovereigns had been
      useful to him, too. Then the train glided from the platform side, plunged
      with a scream through a succession of black tunnels, and with rapidly
      increasing speed faced the storm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young man sat on one side of the saloon and Mr. John P. Dunster on the
      other. Although both of them were provided with a certain amount of
      railway literature, neither of them made any pretence at reading. The
      older man, with his feet upon the opposite seat and his arms folded, was
      looking pensively through the rain-splashed window-pane into the
      impenetrable darkness. The young man, although he could not ignore his
      companion&rsquo;s unsociable instincts, was fidgety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be some floods out to-morrow,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster turned his head and looked across the saloon. There was
      something in the deliberate manner of his doing so, and his hesitation
      before he spoke, which seemed intended to further impress upon the young
      man the fact that he was not disposed for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; was his sole reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald Fentolin sighed as though he regretted his companion&rsquo;s taciturnity
      and a few minutes later strolled to the farther end of the saloon. He
      spent some time trying to peer through the streaming window into the
      darkness. He chatted for a few minutes with the guard, who was, however,
      in a bad temper at having had to turn out and who found little to say.
      Then he took one of his golf clubs from the bag and indulged in several
      half swings. Finally he stretched himself out upon one of the seats and
      closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May as well try to get a nap,&rdquo; he yawned. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much chance on
      the steamer, if it blows like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster said nothing. His face was set, his eyes were looking
      somewhere beyond the confines of the saloon in which he was seated. So
      they travelled for over an hour. The young man seemed to be dozing in
      earnest when, with a succession of jerks, the train rapidly slackened
      speed. Mr. Dunster let down the window. The interior of the carriage was
      at once thrown into confusion. A couple of newspapers were caught up and
      whirled around, a torrent of rain beat in. Mr. Dunster rapidly closed the
      window and rang the bell. The guard came in after a moment or two. His
      clothes were shiny from the wet; raindrops hung from his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster demanded. &ldquo;Why are we waiting here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a block on the line somewhere,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell
      where exactly. The signals are against us; that&rsquo;s all we know at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crawled on again in about ten minutes, stopped, and resumed their
      progress at an even slower rate. Mr. Dunster once more summoned the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are we travelling like this?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. &ldquo;We shall never
      catch the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall catch the boat all right if it runs, sir,&rdquo; the man assured him.
      &ldquo;The mail is only a mile or two ahead of us; that&rsquo;s one reason why we have
      to go so slowly. Then the water is right over the line where we are now,
      and we can&rsquo;t get any news at all from the other side of Ipswich. If it
      goes on like this, some of the bridges will be down; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
      afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster frowned. For the first time he showed some signs of
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he muttered, half to himself, &ldquo;a motor-car would have been
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; his young companion intervened. &ldquo;All the roads to the
      coast here cross no end of small bridges&mdash;much weaker affairs than
      the railway bridges. I bet there are some of those down already. Besides,
      you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see where you were going, on a night like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There appears to be a chance,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster remarked drily, &ldquo;that you will
      have to scratch for your competition to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; the young man observed, &ldquo;that you will have taken this special
      train for nothing. I can&rsquo;t fancy the Harwich boat going out a night like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster relapsed into stony but anxious silence. The train continued
      its erratic progress, sometimes stopping altogether for a time, with
      whistle blowing repeatedly; sometimes creeping along the metals as though
      feeling its way to safety. At last, after a somewhat prolonged wait, the
      guard, whose hoarse voice they had heard on the platform of the small
      station in which they were standing, entered the carriage. With him came a
      gust of wind, once more sending the papers flying around the compartment.
      The rain dripped from his clothes on to the carpet. He had lost his hat,
      his hair was tossed with the wind, his face was bleeding from a slight
      wound on the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat train&rsquo;s just ahead of us, sir,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get on
      any better than we can. We&rsquo;ve just heard that there&rsquo;s a bridge down on the
      line between Ipswich and Harwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do, then?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve come to ask you, sir,&rdquo; the guard replied. &ldquo;The
      mail&rsquo;s going slowly on as far as Ipswich. I fancy they&rsquo;ll lie by there
      until the morning. The best thing that I can see is, if you&rsquo;re agreeable,
      to take you back to London. We can very likely do that all right, if we
      start at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster, ignoring the man&rsquo;s suggestion, drew from one of the
      voluminous pockets of his ulster a small map. He spread it open upon the
      table before him and studied it attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cannot get to Harwich,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is there any possibility of
      keeping straight on and reaching Yarmouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard anything about the line from Ipswich to Norwich, sir,&rdquo;
       he replied, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t very well change our course without definite
      instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your definite instructions,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster reminded him drily, &ldquo;were to
      take me to Harwich. You have been forced to depart from them. I see no
      harm in your adopting any suggestions I may have to make concerning our
      altered destination. I will pay the extra mileage, naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far did you wish to go, sir?&rdquo; the guard enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Yarmouth,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster replied firmly. &ldquo;If there are bridges down, and
      communication with Harwich is blocked, Yarmouth would suit me better than
      anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go on that way, sir, without instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a telegraph office at this station?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can speak anywhere on the line,&rdquo; the guard replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then wire to the station-master at Liverpool Street,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster
      instructed. &ldquo;You can get a reply from him in the course of a few minutes.
      Explain the situation and tell him what my wishes are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goodish way from here to Norwich,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;and for all we
      know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we left Liverpool Street Station,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster interrupted, &ldquo;I
      promised five pounds each to you, the engine-driver, and his mate. That
      five pounds shall be made twenty-five if you succeed in getting me to the
      coast. Do your best for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard raised his hat and departed without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will probably suit you better,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued, turning to his
      companion, &ldquo;to leave me at Ipswich and join the mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s any chance, anyway, of my getting over in time
      now,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll take me on with you as far as Norwich, I can
      go quietly home from there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live in this part of the world, then?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man assented. Again there was a certain amount of hesitation in
      his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live some distance the other side of Norwich,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to sponge on you too much,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;re really going to
      stick it out and try and get there, I&rsquo;d like to go on, too. I am afraid I
      can&rsquo;t offer to share the expense, but I&rsquo;d work my passage if there was
      anything to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster drummed for a moment upon the table with his fingers. All the
      time the young man had been speaking, his eyes had been studying his face.
      He turned now once more to his map.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my idea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to hire a steam trawler from Yarmouth. If I do
      so, you can, if you wish, accompany me so far as the port at which we may
      land in Holland. On the other hand, to be perfectly frank with you, I
      should prefer to go alone. There will be, no doubt, a certain amount of
      risk in crossing to-night. My own business is of importance. A golf
      tournament, however, is scarcely worth risking your life for, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that!&rdquo; the young man replied grimly. &ldquo;I fancy I
      should rather like it. Let&rsquo;s see whether we can get on to Norwich, anyhow,
      shall we? We may find that there are bridges down on that line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They relapsed once more into silence. Presently the guard reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instructions to take you on to Yarmouth, if possible, sir,&rdquo; he announced,
      &ldquo;and to collect the mileage at our destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be quite satisfactory,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster agreed. &ldquo;Let us be off,
      then, as soon as possible.&rdquo; Presently they crawled on. They passed the
      boat train in Ipswich Station, where they stayed for a few moments. Mr.
      Dunster bought wine and sandwiches, and his companion followed his
      example. Then they continued their journey. An hour or more passed; the
      storm showed no signs of abatement. Their speed now rarely exceeded ten or
      fifteen miles an hour. Mr. Dunster smoked all the time, occasionally
      rubbing the window-pane and trying to look out. Gerald Fentolin slept
      fitfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea where we are?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster asked once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy cautiously let down the window a little way. With the noise of the
      storm came another sound, to which he listened for a moment with puzzled
      face: a dull, rumbling sound like the falling of water. He closed the
      window, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we are far from Norwich. We passed Forncett, anyhow, some
      time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still raining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In torrents! I can&rsquo;t see a yard ahead of me. I bet we get some floods
      after this. I expect they are out now, if one could only see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crept on. Suddenly, above the storm, they heard what sounded at first
      like the booming of a gun, and then a shrill whistle from some distance
      ahead. They felt the jerk as their brakes were hastily applied, the
      swaying of the little train, and then the crunching of earth beneath them,
      the roar of escaping steam as their engine ploughed its way on into the
      road bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off the rails!&rdquo; the boy cried, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Hold on tightly,
      sir. I&rsquo;d keep away from the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage swayed and rocked. Suddenly a telegraph post seemed to come
      crashing through the window and the polished mahogany panels. The young
      man escaped it by leaping to one side. It caught Mr. Dunster, who had just
      risen to his feet, upon the forehead. There was a crash all around of
      splitting glass, a further shock. They were both thrown off their feet.
      The light was suddenly extinguished. With the crashing of glass, the
      splitting of timber&mdash;a hideous, tearing sound&mdash;the wrecked
      saloon, dragging the engine half-way over with it, slipped down a low
      embankment and lay on its side, what remained of it, in a field of
      turnips.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the young man staggered to his feet, he had somehow a sense of
      detachment, as though he were commencing a new life, or had suddenly come
      into a new existence. Yet his immediate surroundings were charged with
      ugly reminiscences. Through a great gap in the ruined side of the saloon
      the rain was tearing in. As he stood up, his head caught the fragments of
      the roof. He was able to push back the wreckage with ease and step out.
      For a moment he reeled, as he met the violence of the storm. Then,
      clutching hold of the side of the wreck, he steadied himself. A light was
      moving back and forth, close at hand. He cried out weakly: &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man carrying a lantern, bent double as he made his way against the wind,
      crawled up to them. He was a porter from the station close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Any one alive here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Gerald muttered, &ldquo;at least, I suppose I am. What&rsquo;s it all&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      it all about? We&rsquo;ve had an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The porter caught hold of a piece of the wreckage with which to steady
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your train ran right into three feet of water,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The rails
      had gone&mdash;torn up. The telegraph line&rsquo;s down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stop the train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were doing all we could,&rdquo; the man retorted gloomily. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t
      expecting anything else through to-night. We&rsquo;d a man along the line with a
      lantern, but he&rsquo;s just been found blown over the embankment, with his head
      in a pool of water. Any one else in your carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One gentleman travelling with me,&rdquo; Gerald answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better try to
      get him out. What about the guard and engine-driver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The engine-driver and stoker are both alive,&rdquo; the porter told him. &ldquo;I
      came across them before I saw you. They&rsquo;re both knocked sort of sillylike,
      but they aren&rsquo;t much hurt. The guard&rsquo;s stone dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few hundred yards from Wymondham. Let&rsquo;s have a look for the other
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster was lying quite still, his right leg doubled up, and a
      huge block of telegraph post, which the saloon had carried with it in its
      fall, still pressing against his forehead. He groaned as they dragged him
      out and laid him down upon a cushion in the shelter of the wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive all right,&rdquo; the porter remarked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a doctor on the way.
      Let&rsquo;s cover him up quick and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we carry him to shelter of some sort?&rdquo; Gerald proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head. Speech of any sort was difficult. Even with his
      lips close to the other&rsquo;s ears, he had almost to shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one can do to walk alone when
      you get out in the middle of the field, away from the shelter of the
      embankment here. There&rsquo;s bits of trees flying all down the lane. Never was
      such a night! Folks is fair afraid of the morning to see what&rsquo;s happened.
      There&rsquo;s a mill blown right over on its side in the next field, and the man
      in charge of it lying dead. This poor chap&rsquo;s bad enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald, on all fours, had crept back into the compartment. The bottle of
      wine was smashed into atoms. He came out, dragging the small dressing-case
      which his companion had kept on the table before him. One side of it was
      dented in, but the lock, which was of great strength, still held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;s a flask somewhere in this dressing-case,&rdquo; Gerald said.
      &ldquo;Lend me a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strong though it had been, the lock was already almost torn out from its
      foundation. They forced the spring and opened it. The porter turned his
      lantern on the widening space. Just as Gerald was raising the lid very
      slowly to save the contents from being scattered by the wind, the man
      turned his head to answer an approaching hail. Gerald raised the lid a
      little higher and suddenly closed it with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s folks coming at last!&rdquo; the porter exclaimed, turning around
      excitedly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been a time and no mistake. The village isn&rsquo;t a
      quarter of a mile away. Did you find a flask, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald made no answer. The dressing-case once more was closed, and his
      hand pressed upon the lid. The porter turned the light upon his face and
      whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about done yourself, sir,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Hold up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the young man in his arms. There was another roar in Gerald&rsquo;s
      ears besides the roar of the wind. He had never fainted in his life, but
      the feeling was upon him now&mdash;a deadly sickness, a swaying of the
      earth. The porter suddenly gave a little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not a born idiot!&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing a bottle from the pocket
      of his coat with his disengaged hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s whisky here. I was taking
      it home to the missis for her rheumatism. Now, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew the cork from the bottle with his teeth and forced some of the
      liquid between the lips of the young man. The voices now were coming
      nearer and nearer. Gerald made a desperate effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They groped their way towards the unconscious man, Gerald still gripping
      the dressing-case with both hands. There were no signs of any change in
      his condition, but he was still breathing heavily. Then they heard a shout
      behind, almost in their ears. The porter staggered to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought blankets and a
      stretcher and brandy. Here&rsquo;s a doctor, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A powerful-looking man, hatless, and wrapped in a great ulster, moved
      towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many are there of you?&rdquo; he asked, as he bent over Mr. Dunster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only we two,&rdquo; Gerald replied. &ldquo;Is my friend badly hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concussion,&rdquo; the doctor announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him to the village. What
      about you, young man? Your face is bleeding, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a cut,&rdquo; Gerald faltered; &ldquo;nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky chap,&rdquo; the doctor remarked. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him to shelter of some sort.
      Come along. There&rsquo;s an inn at the corner of the lane there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all staggered along, Gerald still clutching the dressing-case, and
      supported on the other side by an excited and somewhat incoherent
      villager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a storm as never was,&rdquo; the latter volunteered. &ldquo;The telegraph wires
      are all down for miles and miles. There won&rsquo;t be no trains running along
      this line come many a week, and as for trees&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s as though
      some one had been playing ninepins in Squire Fellowes&rsquo;s park. When the
      morning do come, for sure there will be things to be seen. This way, sir.
      Be careful of the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They staggered along down the lane, climbing once over a tree which lay
      across the lane and far into the adjoining field. Soon they were joined by
      more of the villagers, roused from their beds by rumours of terrible
      happenings. The little, single-storey, ivy-covered inn was all lit up and
      the door held firmly open. They passed through the narrow entrance and
      into the stone-flagged barroom, where the men laid down their stretcher.
      As many of the villagers as could crowd in filled the passage. Gerald sank
      into a chair. The sudden absence of wind was almost disconcerting. He felt
      himself once more in danger of fainting. He was only vaguely conscious of
      drinking hot milk, poured from a jug by a red-faced and sympathetic woman.
      Its restorative effect, however, was immediate and wonderful. The mist
      cleared from before his eyes, his brain began to work. Always in the
      background the horror and the shame were there, the shame which kept his
      hand pressed with unnatural strength upon the broken lock of that
      dressing-case. He sat a little apart from the others and listened. Above
      the confused murmur of voices he could hear the doctor&rsquo;s comment and brief
      orders, as he rose to his feet after examining the unconscious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ordinary concussion,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I must get round and see the
      engine-driver now. They have got him in a shed by the embankment. I&rsquo;ll
      call in again later on. Let&rsquo;s have one more look at you, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the cut on Gerald&rsquo;s forehead, noted the access of colour in
      his cheeks, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Born to be hanged, you were,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a marvellous
      escape. I&rsquo;ll be in again presently. No need to worry about your friend. He
      looks as though he&rsquo;d got a mighty constitution. Light my lantern, Brown.
      Two of you had better come with me to the shed. It&rsquo;s no night for a man to
      be wandering about alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed, and many of the villagers with him. The landlady sat down and
      began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a night! Such a night!&rdquo; she exclaimed, wringing her hands. &ldquo;And
      there&rsquo;s the doctor talks about putting the poor gentleman to bed! Why, the
      roof&rsquo;s off the back part of the house, and not a bedroom in the place but
      mine and John&rsquo;s, and the rain coming in there in torrents. Such a night!
      It&rsquo;s the judgment of the Lord upon us! That&rsquo;s what it is&mdash;the
      judgment of the Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judgment of the fiddlesticks!&rdquo; her husband growled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you light the
      fire, woman? What&rsquo;s the good of sitting there whining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light the fire,&rdquo; she repeated bitterly, &ldquo;and the chimney lying out in the
      road! Do you want to suffocate us all, or is the beer still in your head?
      It&rsquo;s your evil doings, Richard Budden, and others like you, that have
      brought this upon us. If Mr. Wembley would but come in and pray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband scoffed. He was dressed only in his shirt and trousers, his
      hair rough, his braces hanging down behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and pray!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Not he! Not Mr. Wembley! He&rsquo;s safe
      tucked up in his bed, shivering with fear, I&rsquo;ll bet you. He&rsquo;s not getting
      his feet wet to save a body or lend a hand here. Souls are his job. You
      let the preacher alone, mother, and tell us what we&rsquo;re going to do with
      this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord only knows!&rdquo; she cried, wringing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I hire a motor-car from anywhere near?&rdquo; Gerald asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s motor-cars, right enough,&rdquo; the innkeeper replied, &ldquo;but not many
      as would be fools enough to take one out. You couldn&rsquo;t see the road, and I
      doubt if one of them plaguey things would stir in this storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such nonsense as you talk, Richard Budden!&rdquo; his wife exclaimed sharply.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s twenty minutes past three of the clock, and there&rsquo;s light coming on
      us fast. If so be as the young gentleman knows folks round about here, or
      happens to live nigh, why shouldn&rsquo;t he take one of them motor-cars and get
      away to some decent place? It&rsquo;ll be better for the poor gentleman than
      lying here in a house smitten by the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald rose stiffly to his feet. An idea was forming in his brain. His
      eyes were bright. He looked at the body of John Dunster upon the floor,
      and felt once more in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far off is the garage?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right across the way,&rdquo; the innkeeper replied, &ldquo;a speculation of
      Neighbour Martin&rsquo;s, and a foolish one it do seem to me. He&rsquo;s two cars
      there, and one he lets to the Government for delivering the mails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald felt in his pocket and produced a sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to any man you can find who will go across there
      and bring me a car&mdash;the most powerful they&rsquo;ve got, if there&rsquo;s any
      difference. Tell them I&rsquo;ll pay well. This&mdash;my friend will be much
      better at home with me than in a strange place when he comes to his
      senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sound common sense,&rdquo; the woman declared. &ldquo;Be off with you, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was looking at the coin covetously, but his wife pushed him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a sovereign you&rsquo;ll be taking from the gentleman for a little
      errand like that,&rdquo; she insisted sharply. &ldquo;He shall pay us for what he&rsquo;s
      had when he goes, and welcome, and if so be that he&rsquo;s willing to make it a
      sovereign, to include the milk and the brandy and the confusion we&rsquo;ve been
      put to this night, well and good. It&rsquo;s a heavy reckoning, maybe, but the
      night calls for it. We&rsquo;ll see about that afterwards. Get along with you, I
      say, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be wet through,&rdquo; the man muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And serve you right!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a man in this
      village to-night whose clothes are dry, it&rsquo;s a thing for him to be ashamed
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper reluctantly departed. They heard the roar of the wind as the
      door was opened and closed. The woman poured out another glass of milk and
      brought it to Gerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A godless man, mine,&rdquo; she said grimly. &ldquo;If so happen as Mr. Wembley had
      come to these parts years ago, I&rsquo;d have seen myself in my grave before I&rsquo;d
      have married a publican. But it&rsquo;s too late now. We&rsquo;re mostly too late
      about the things that count in this world. So it&rsquo;s your friend that&rsquo;s been
      stricken down, young man. A well-living man, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shivered ever so slightly. He drank the milk, however. He felt that
      he might need his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What train might you have been on?&rdquo; the woman continued. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s none
      due on this line that we knew of. David Bass, the station-master, was here
      but two hours ago and said he&rsquo;d finished for the night, and praised the
      Lord for that. The goods trains had all been stopped at Ipswich, and the
      first passenger train was not due till six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shook his head with an affectation of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything about it. We were
      hours late, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman was looking down at the unconscious man. Gerald rose slowly to
      his feet and stood by her side. The face of Mr. John P. Dunster, even in
      unconsciousness, had something in it of strength and purpose. The shape of
      his head, the squareness of his jaws, the straightness of his thick lips,
      all seemed to speak of a hard and inflexible disposition. His hair was
      coal black, coarse, and without the slightest sprinkling of grey. He had
      the neck and throat of a fighter. But for that single, livid, blue mark
      across his forehead, he carried with him no signs of his accident. He was
      a little inclined to be stout. There was a heavy gold chain stretched
      across his waist-coat. From where he lay, the shining handle of his
      revolver protruded from his hip, pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; the woman muttered, as she looked down. &ldquo;What does he carry
      a thing like that for&mdash;in a peaceful country, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just an idea of his,&rdquo; Gerald answered. &ldquo;We were going abroad in a
      day or two. He was always nervous. If you like, I&rsquo;ll take it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped down and withdrew it from the unconscious man&rsquo;s pocket. He
      started as he discovered that it was loaded in every chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear the sight of them things,&rdquo; the woman declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the men
      of evil ways, who&rsquo;ve no trust in the Lord, who need that sort of
      protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard the door pushed open, the howl of wind down the passage, and
      the beating of rain upon the stone flags. Then it was softly closed again.
      The landlord staggered into the room, followed by a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This &lsquo;ere is Mr. Martin&rsquo;s chaffer,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You can tell him what
      you want yerself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald turned almost eagerly towards the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to the other side of Holt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and get my friend&mdash;get
      this gentleman away from here&mdash;get him home, if possible. Can you
      take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur looked doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of the roads, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s talk about many
      bridges down, and trees, and there&rsquo;s floods out everywhere. There&rsquo;s half a
      foot of water, even, across the village street now. I&rsquo;m afraid we
      shouldn&rsquo;t get very far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Gerald begged eagerly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a shot at it. I&rsquo;ll pay you
      double the hire of the car, and I&rsquo;ll be responsible for any damage. I want
      to get out of this beastly place. Let&rsquo;s get somewhere, at any rate,
      towards a civilised country. I&rsquo;ll see you don&rsquo;t lose anything. I&rsquo;ll give
      you a five pound note for yourself if we get as far as Holt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; the young man agreed shortly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an open car, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Gerald replied. &ldquo;I can stick it in front with you,
      and we can cover&mdash;him up in the tonneau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait until the doctor comes back?&rdquo; the landlord asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should they?&rdquo; his wife interposed sharply. &ldquo;Them doctors are all
      the same. He&rsquo;ll try and keep the poor gentleman here for the sake of a few
      extra guineas, and a miserable place for him to open his eyes upon, even
      if the rest of the roof holds, which for my part I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt.
      They&rsquo;d have to move him from here with the daylight, anyhow. He can&rsquo;t lie
      in the bar parlour all day, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem right, somehow,&rdquo; the man complained doggedly. &ldquo;The doctor
      didn&rsquo;t say anything about having him moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get the car,&rdquo; Gerald ordered the young man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the whole
      responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur silently left the room. Gerald put a couple of sovereigns
      upon the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend is a man of somewhat peculiar temperament,&rdquo; he said quietly.
      &ldquo;If he finds himself at home in a comfortable room when he comes to his
      senses, I am quite sure that he will have a better chance of recovery. He
      cannot possibly be made comfortable here, and he will feel the shock of
      what has happened all the more if he finds himself still in the
      neighbourhood when he opens his eyes. If there is any change in his
      condition, we can easily stop somewhere on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman pocketed the two sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s common sense, sir,&rdquo; she agreed heartily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure we are very
      much obliged to you. If we had a decent room, and a roof above it, you&rsquo;d
      be heartily welcome, but as it is, this is no place for a sick man, and
      those that say different don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about. That&rsquo;s a
      real careful young man who&rsquo;s going to take you along in the motor-car.
      He&rsquo;ll get you there safe, if any one will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is,&rdquo; her husband protested sullenly, &ldquo;that we ought to wait
      for the doctor&rsquo;s orders. I&rsquo;m against seeing a poor body like that jolted
      across the country in an open motor-car, in his state. I&rsquo;m not sure that
      it&rsquo;s for his good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what business is it of yours, I should like to know?&rdquo; the woman
      demanded sharply. &ldquo;You get up-stairs and begin moving the furniture from
      where the rain&rsquo;s coming sopping in. And if so be you can remember while
      you do it that this is a judgment that&rsquo;s come upon us, why, so much the
      better. We are evil-doers, all of us, though them as likes the easy ways
      generally manage to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man retreated silently. The woman sat down upon a stool and waited.
      Gerald sat opposite to her, the battered dressing-case upon his knees.
      Between them was stretched the body of the unconscious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you used to prayer, young sir?&rdquo; the woman asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shook his head, and the woman did not pursue the subject. Only once
      her eyes were half closed and her words drifted across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord have mercy on this man, a sinner!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice to you, sir, is to chuck it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald turned towards the chauffeur by whose side he was seated a little
      stiffly, for his limbs were numbed with the cold and exhaustion. The
      morning had broken with a grey and uncertain light. A vaporous veil of
      mist seemed to have taken the place of the darkness. Even from the top of
      the hill where the car had come to a standstill, there was little to be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have come forty miles already,&rdquo; the chauffeur continued, &ldquo;what
      with going out of our way all the time because of the broken bridges. I&rsquo;m
      pretty well frozen through, and as for him,&rdquo; he added, jerking his thumb
      across his shoulder, &ldquo;it seems to me you&rsquo;re taking a bit of a risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor said he would remain in exactly the same condition for
      twenty-four hours,&rdquo; Gerald declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything about shaking him up over forty miles of
      rough road,&rdquo; the other protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he continued,
      in a slightly changed tone; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t my business, of course, but I&rsquo;m
      fairly done. It don&rsquo;t seem reasonable to stick at it like this. There&rsquo;s
      Holt village not a mile away, and a comfortable inn and a fire waiting. I
      thought that was as far as you wanted to come. We might lie up there for a
      few hours, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His passenger slipped down from his place, and, lifting the rug, peered
      into the tonneau of the car, over which they had tied a hood. To all
      appearance, the condition of the man who lay there was unchanged. There
      was a slightly added blueness about the lips but his breathing was still
      perceptible. It seemed even a little stronger. Gerald resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while to stay at Holt,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;We are scarcely
      seven miles from home now. Sit still for a few minutes and get your wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only seven miles,&rdquo; the chauffeur repeated more cheerfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      something, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all downhill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards the sea, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight to the sea,&rdquo; Gerald told him. &ldquo;The place we are making for is
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall, near Salthouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur seemed a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Squire Fentolin&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where we are going. You follow this road almost straight ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur slipped in the clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know the way now, sir, right enough!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      Salthouse marsh to cross, though. I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall manage that all right,&rdquo; Gerald declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve more light now,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both looked around. During the last few minutes the late morning
      seemed to have forced its way through the clouds. They had a dim,
      phantasmagoric view of the stricken country: a watery plain, with here and
      there great patches of fields, submerged to the hedges, and houses
      standing out amidst the waste of waters like toy dwellings. There were
      whole plantations of uprooted trees. Close to the road, on their left, was
      a roofless house, and a family of children crying underneath a tarpaulin
      shelter. As they crept on, the wind came to them with a brackish flavour,
      salt with the sea. The chauffeur was gazing ahead doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of the marsh,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see the road at
      all. However, here goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another half-hour,&rdquo; Gerald assured him encouragingly, &ldquo;and we shall be at
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall. You can have as much rest as you like then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were facing the wind now, and conversation became impossible. Twice
      they had to pull up sharp and make a considerable detour, once on account
      of a fallen tree which blocked the road, and another time because of the
      yawning gap where a bridge had fallen away. Gerald, however, knew every
      inch of the country they were in and was able to give the necessary
      directions. They began to meet farm wagons now, full of people who had
      been driven from their homes. Warnings and information as to the state of
      the roads were shouted to them continually. Presently they came to the
      last steep descent, and emerged from the devastated fragment of a wood
      almost on to the sea level. The chauffeur clapped on his brakes and
      stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s more trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald for a moment was speechless. They seemed to have come suddenly upon
      a huge plain of waters, an immense lake reaching as far as they could see
      on either side. The road before them stretched like a ribbon for the next
      three miles. Here and there it disappeared and reappeared again. In many
      places it was lapped by little waves. Everywhere the hedges were either
      altogether or half under water. In the distance was one farmhouse, only
      the roof of which was visible, and from which the inhabitants were
      clambering into a boat. And beyond, with scarcely a break save for the
      rising of one strangely-shaped hill, was the sea. Gerald pointed with his
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s St. David&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the other side of the hill. The
      road seems all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it!&rdquo; the chauffeur grunted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s under water more than half the
      way, and Heaven knows how deep it is at the sides! I&rsquo;m not going to risk
      my life along there. I am going to take the car back to Holt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand was already upon the reverse lever, but Gerald gripped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t come all this way to turn back. You
      don&rsquo;t look like a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a coward, sir,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. &ldquo;Neither am I a fool. I
      don&rsquo;t see any use in risking our lives and my master&rsquo;s motor-car, because
      you want to get home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Gerald answered calmly, &ldquo;but remember this. I am responsible
      for your car&mdash;not you. Mr. Fentolin is my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur nodded shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Gerald Fentolin, aren&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I thought I
      recognised you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Gerald admitted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a rough journey, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem
      sense to turn back now, does it, with the house in sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, sir,&rdquo; the chauffeur objected doubtfully, &ldquo;but I
      don&rsquo;t believe the road&rsquo;s even passable, and the floods seem to me to be
      rising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; the young man begged. &ldquo;Look here, I don&rsquo;t want to bribe you, or
      anything of that sort. You know you&rsquo;re coming out of this well. It&rsquo;s a
      serious matter for me, and I shan&rsquo;t be likely to forget it. I want to take
      this gentleman to St. David&rsquo;s Hall and not to a hospital. You&rsquo;ve brought
      me here so far like a man. Let&rsquo;s go through with it. If the worst comes to
      the worst, we can both swim, I suppose, and we are not likely to get out
      of our depth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur moved his head backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must take his chance,&rdquo; Gerald replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right where he is.
      The car won&rsquo;t upset and there are plenty of people who&rsquo;ll see if we get
      into trouble. Come, let&rsquo;s make a dash for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur thrust in his clutch and settled himself down. They glided
      off along that winding stretch of road. To its very edge, on either side
      of them, so close that they could almost touch it, came the water, water
      which stretched as far as they could see, swaying, waveless,
      sinister-looking. Even Gerald, after his first impulse of wonder, kept his
      eyes averted and fixed upon the road ahead. Soon they reached a place
      where the water met in front. There were only the rows of white palings on
      either side to guide them. The chauffeur muttered to himself as he changed
      to his first speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the engine gets stopped,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we shall get out
      of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They emerged on the other side. For some time they had a clear run. Then
      suddenly the driver clapped on his brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get through that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In front of them for more than a hundred yards the water seemed suddenly
      to have flowed across the road. Still a mile distant, perched on a ridge
      of that strangely-placed hill, was their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done, sir!&rdquo; the man groaned. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a car ever built
      could get through that. See, it&rsquo;s nearly up to the top of those posts. I
      must put her in the reverse and get back, even if we have to wait on the
      higher part of the road for a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced behind, and a second cry broke from his lips. Gerald stood up
      in his place. Already the road which had been clear a few minutes before
      was hidden. The water was washing almost over the tops of the white posts
      behind them. Little waves were breaking against the summit of the raised
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re cut off!&rdquo; the chauffeur exclaimed. &ldquo;What a fool I was to try this!
      There&rsquo;s the tide coming in as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald sat down in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t go back, whether we want to or not. It&rsquo;s
      much worse behind there than it is in front. There&rsquo;s only one chance. Go
      for it straight ahead in your first speed. It may not stop the engine. In
      any case, it will be worse presently. There&rsquo;s no use funking it. If the
      worst happens, we can sit in the car. The water won&rsquo;t be above our heads
      and there are some boats about. Blow your horn well first, in case there&rsquo;s
      any one within hearing, and then go for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur obeyed. They hissed and spluttered into the water. Soon all
      trace of the road was completely lost. They steered only by the tops of
      the white posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting deeper,&rdquo; the man declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s within an inch or two of
      the bonnet now. Hold on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave broke almost over them but the engine continued its beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we stop now,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engine began to knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick at it,&rdquo; Gerald cried, rising in his place a little. &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s
      only one post lower than the last one that we passed. They get higher all
      the time, ahead. You can almost see the road in front there. Now, in with
      your gear again, and stick at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another wave broke, this time completely over them. They listened with
      strained ears&mdash;the engine continued to beat. They still moved slowly.
      Then there was a shock. The wheel had struck something in the road&mdash;a
      great stone or rock. The chauffeur thrust the car out of gear. The engine
      still beat. Gerald leaped from the car. The water was over his knees. He
      crossed in front of the bonnet and stooped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, tugging hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved it, rolled it on one side, and pushed at the wheel of the car as
      his companion put in the speed. They started again. He jumped back his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it, all right!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s getting lower
      all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur had lost his nerve. His cheeks were pale, his teeth were
      chattering. The engine, however, was still beating. Gradually the pressure
      of the water grew less. In front of them they caught a glimpse of the
      road. They drew up at the top of a little bridge over one of the dikes.
      Gerald uttered a brief exclamation of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; he almost sobbed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the road, straight ahead and
      round to the right. There&rsquo;s no more water anywhere near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had left the main part of the flood behind them. There were still
      great pools in the side of the road, and huge masses of seaweed had been
      carried up and were lying in their track. There was no more water,
      however. At every moment they drew nearer to the strangely-shaped hill
      with its crown of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is on the other side,&rdquo; Gerald pointed out. &ldquo;We can go through
      the lodge gates at the back here. The ascent isn&rsquo;t so steep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned sharply to the right, along another stretch of straight road
      set with white posts, ending before a red brick lodge and a closed gate.
      They blew the horn and a gardener came out. He gazed at them in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Gerald cried. &ldquo;Let us through quickly, Foulds. We&rsquo;ve a
      gentleman in behind who&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man swung open the gate with a respectful salute. They made their way
      up a winding drive of considerable length, and at last they came to a
      broad, open space almost like a platform. On their left were the marshes,
      and beyond, the sea. Along their right stretched the long front of an
      Elizabethan mansion. They drew up in front of the hall door. Their coming
      had been observed, and servants were already waiting. Gerald sprang to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman in behind who&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; he explained to the butler. &ldquo;He
      has met with an accident on the way. Three or four of you had better carry
      him up to a bedroom&mdash;any one that is ready. And you, George,&rdquo; he
      added, turning to a boy, &ldquo;get into the car and show this man the way round
      to the garage, and then take him to the servants&rsquo; hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several of the servants hastened to do his bidding, and Gerald did his
      best to answer the eager but respectful stream of questions. And then,
      just as they were in the act of lifting the still unconscious man on to
      the floor of the hall, came a queer sound&mdash;a shrill, reverberating
      whistle. They all looked up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master is awake,&rdquo; Henderson, the butler, remarked, dropping his voice
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to him at once,&rdquo; he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accustomed though he was to the sight which he was about to face, Gerald
      shivered slightly as he opened the door of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s room. A strange
      sort of fear seemed to have crept into his bearing and expression, a fear
      of which there had been no traces whatever during those terrible hours
      through which he had passed&mdash;not even during that last reckless
      journey across the marshes. He walked with hesitating footsteps across the
      spacious and lofty room. He had the air of some frightened creature
      approaching his master. Yet all that was visible of the despot who ruled
      his whole household in deadly fear was the kindly and beautiful face of an
      elderly man, whose stunted limbs and body were mercifully concealed. He
      sat in a little carriage, with a rug drawn closely across his chest and up
      to his armpits. His beautifully shaped hands were exposed, and his face;
      nothing else. His hair was a silvery white; his complexion parchment-like,
      pallid, entirely colourless. His eyes were a soft shade of blue. His
      features were so finely cut and chiselled that they resembled some
      exquisite piece of statuary. He smiled as his nephew came slowly towards
      him. One might almost have fancied that the young man&rsquo;s abject state was a
      source of pleasure to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are back again, my dear Gerald. A pleasant surprise, indeed, but
      what is the meaning of it? And what of my little commission, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s face was dark and sullen. He spoke quickly but without any
      sign of eagerness or interest in the information he vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm has stopped all the trains,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boat did not cross
      last night, and in any case I couldn&rsquo;t have reached Harwich. As for your
      commission, I travelled down from London alone with the man you told me to
      spy upon. I could have stolen anything he had if I had been used to the
      work. As it was&mdash;I brought the man himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s delicate fingers played with the handle of his chair. The
      smile had passed from his lips. He looked at his nephew in gentle
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;come, come, be careful what you are saying.
      You have brought the man himself! So far as my information goes, Mr. John
      P. Dunster is charged with a very important diplomatic commission. He is
      on his way to Cologne, and from what I know about the man, I think that it
      would require more than your persuasions to induce him to break off his
      journey. You do not really wish me to believe that you have brought him
      here as a guest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at Liverpool Street Station last night,&rdquo; Gerald declared. &ldquo;I had no
      idea how to accost him, and as to stealing any of his belongings, I
      couldn&rsquo;t have done it. You must hear how fortune helped me, though. Mr.
      Dunster missed the train; so did I&mdash;purposely. He ordered a special.
      I asked permission to travel with him. I told him a lie as to how I had
      missed the train. I hated it, but it was necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to trifle with the truth is always unpleasant.
      Besides, you are a Fentolin, and our love of truth is proverbial. But
      there are times, you know, when for the good of others we must sacrifice
      our scruples. So you told Mr. Dunster a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He let me travel with him,&rdquo; Gerald continued. &ldquo;We were all night getting
      about half-way here. Then&mdash;you know about the storm, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin spread out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could one avoid the knowledge of it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Such a sight has never
      been seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We found we couldn&rsquo;t get to Harwich,&rdquo; Gerald went on. &ldquo;They telegraphed
      to London and got permission to bring us to Yarmouth. We were on our way
      to Norwich, and the train ran off the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our train ran off the line and pitched down an embankment. Mr. Dunster
      has concussion of the brain. He and I were taken to a miserable little inn
      near Wymondham. From there I hired a motor-car and brought him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hired a motor-car and brought him here,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated
      softly. &ldquo;My dear boy&mdash;forgive me if I find this a little hard to
      understand. You say that you have brought him here. Had he nothing to say
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was unconscious when we picked him up,&rdquo; Gerald explained. &ldquo;He is
      unconscious now. The doctor said he would remain so for at least
      twenty-four hours, and it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that the journey would do him
      any particular harm. The roof had been stripped off the inn where we were,
      and the place was quite uninhabitable, so we should have had to have moved
      him somewhere. We put him in the tonneau of the car and covered him up.
      They have carried him now into a bedroom, and Sarson is looking after
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat quite silent. His eyes blinked once or twice, and there
      was a curious curve about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well, my boy,&rdquo; he pronounced slowly. &ldquo;Your scheme of
      bringing him here sounds a little primitive, but success justifies
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin raised to his lips and blew softly a little gold whistle
      which hung from a chain attached to his waistcoat. Almost immediately the
      door opened. A man entered, dressed somberly in black, whose bearing and
      demeanour alike denoted the servant, but whose physique was the physique
      of a prize-fighter. He was scarcely more than five feet six in height, but
      his shoulders were extraordinarily broad. He had a short, bull neck and
      long, mighty arms. His face, with the heavy jaw and small eyes, was the
      face of the typical fighting man, yet his features seemed to have become
      disposed by habit into an expression of gentle, almost servile civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said, &ldquo;a visitor has arrived. Do you happen to
      have noticed what luggage he brought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one small dressing-case, sir,&rdquo; the man replied; &ldquo;nothing else
      that I have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all we brought,&rdquo; Gerald interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bring the dressing-case here at once,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin directed,
      &ldquo;and also my compliments to Doctor Sarson, and any pocket-book or papers
      which may help us to send a message to the gentleman&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins closed the door and departed. Mr. Fentolin turned back towards his
      nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me why you look as though there were ghosts
      flitting about the room? You are not ill, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired, perhaps,&rdquo; Gerald answered shortly. &ldquo;We were many hours in the car.
      I have had no sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face was full of kindly sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am selfish, indeed! I should not have
      kept you here for a moment. You had better go and lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go directly,&rdquo; Gerald promised. &ldquo;Can I speak to you for one moment
      first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to me,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated, a little wonderingly. &ldquo;My dear
      Gerald, is there ever a moment when I am not wholly at your service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow Dunster, on the platform, the first moment I spoke to him,
      made me feel like a cur,&rdquo; the boy said, with a sudden access of vigour in
      his tone. &ldquo;I told him I was on my way to a golf tournament, and he pointed
      to the news about the war. Is it true, uncle, that we may be at war at any
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A terrible reflection, my dear boy,&rdquo; he admitted softly, &ldquo;but, alas! the
      finger of probability points that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what about me?&rdquo; Gerald exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to complain, but
      listen. You dragged me home from a public school before I could even join
      my cadet corps. You&rsquo;ve kept me banging around here with a tutor. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t let me go to the university. You&rsquo;ve stopped my entering either of
      the services. I am nineteen years old and useless. Do you know what I
      should do to-morrow if war broke out? Enlist! It&rsquo;s the only thing left for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You must not talk like that! I am quite sure
      that it would break your mother&rsquo;s heart. Enlist, indeed! Nothing of the
      sort. You are part of the civilian population of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Civilian population be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&rdquo; the boy suddenly cried, white
      with rage. &ldquo;Uncle, forgive me, I have stood all I can bear. If you won&rsquo;t
      let me go in for the army&mdash;I could pass my exams to-morrow&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      off. I&rsquo;ll enlist without waiting for the war. I can&rsquo;t bear this idle life
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy turned his head, turned it unwillingly. He had the air of a caged
      animal obeying the word of his keeper. A certain savage uncouthness seemed
      to have fallen upon him during the last few minutes. There was something
      almost like a snarl in his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was obvious that there was something between those two, some
      memory or some living thing, seldom, if ever, to be spoken of, and yet
      always present. The boy began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little overwrought, Gerald,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;Sit quietly
      in my easy-chair for a few moments. Wait until I have examined Mr.
      Dunster&rsquo;s belongings. Ah! Meekins has been prompt, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a stealthy tap at the door. Meekins entered with the small
      dressing-case in his hand. He brought it over to his master&rsquo;s chair. Mr.
      Fentolin pointed to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it there, Meekins,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I fancy that the pocket-book you
      are carrying will prove more interesting. We will just glance through the
      dressing-case first. Thank you. Yes, you can lay the things upon the
      floor. A man of Spartan-like life, I should imagine Mr. Dunster. A spare
      toothbrush, though, I am glad to see. Pyjamas of most unattractive
      pattern. And what a taste in shirts! Nothing but wearing apparel and
      singularly little of that, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dressing-case was empty, its contents upon the floor. Mr. Fentolin
      held out his hand and took the pocket-book which Meekins had been
      carrying. It was an ordinary morocco affair, similar to those issued by
      American banking houses to enclose letters of credit. One side of it was
      filled with notes. Mr. Fentolin withdrew them and glanced them through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No wonder our friend engages special trains! He
      travels like a prince, indeed. Two thousand pounds, or near it, in this
      little compartment. And here, I see, a letter, a sealed letter with no
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held it out in front of him. It was a long commercial envelope of
      ordinary type, and although the flap was secured with a blob of sealing
      wax, there was no particular impression upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can match this envelope, I think,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said softly. &ldquo;The seal
      we can copy. I think that, for the sake of others, we must discover the
      cause for this hurried journey on the part of Mr. John P. Dunster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his long, delicate forefinger Mr. Fentolin slit the envelope and
      withdrew the single sheet of paper which it contained. There were a dozen
      lines of written matter, and what appeared to be a dozen signatures
      appended. Mr. Fentolin read it, at first with ordinary interest. Then a
      change came. The look of a man drawn out of himself, drawn out of all
      knowledge of his surroundings or his present state, stole into his face.
      Literally he became transfixed. The delicate fingers of his left hand
      gripped the sides of his little carriage. His eyes shone as though those
      few written lines upon which they were riveted were indeed some message
      from an unknown, an unimagined world. Yet no word ever passed his lips.
      There came a time when the tension seemed a little relaxed. With fingers
      which still trembled, he folded up the sheet and replaced it in the
      envelope. He guarded it with both his hands and sat quite still. Neither
      Gerald nor his servant moved. Somehow, the sense of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s
      suppressed excitement seemed to have become communicated to them. It was a
      little tableau, broken at last by Mr. Fentolin himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; he said, turning to Gerald, &ldquo;to be alone. It may interest
      you to know that this document which Mr. Dunster has brought across the
      seas, and which I hold in my hands, is the most amazing message of modern
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; he asked abruptly. &ldquo;Do you want any
      one in from the telegraph room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I am going to reflect. Meekins, my chair to
      the north window&mdash;so. I am going to sit here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and I am
      going to look across the sea and reflect. A very fortunate storm, after
      all, I think, which kept Mr. John P. Dunster from the Harwich boat last
      night. Leave me, Gerald, for a time. Stand behind my chair, Meekins, and
      see that no one enters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat in his chair, his hands still gripping the wonderful
      document, his eyes travelling over the ocean now flecked with sunlight.
      His eyes were fixed upon the horizon. He looked steadily eastward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster opened his eyes upon strange surroundings. He found
      himself lying upon a bed deliciously soft, with lace-edged sheets and
      lavender-perfumed bed hangings. Through the discreetly opened upper window
      came a pleasant and ozone-laden breeze. The furniture in the room was
      mostly of an old-fashioned type, some of it of oak, curiously carved, and
      most of it surmounted with a coat of arms. The apartment was lofty and of
      almost palatial proportions. The whole atmosphere of the place breathed
      comfort and refinement. The only thing of which he did not wholly approve
      was the face of the nurse who rose silently to her feet at his murmured
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt his forehead, altered a bandage for a moment, and took his wrist
      between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been ill,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was a railway accident. You are to
      lie quite still and not say a word. I am going to fetch the doctor now. He
      wished to see you directly you spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster dozed again for several moments. When he reopened his eyes, a
      man was standing by his bedside, a short man with a black beard and
      gold-rimmed glasses. Mr. Dunster, in this first stage of his
      convalescence, was perhaps difficult to please, for he did not like the
      look of the doctor, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me where I am?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been in a railway accident,&rdquo; the doctor told him, &ldquo;and you were
      brought here afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a railway accident,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster repeated. &ldquo;Ah, yes, I remember! I
      took a special to Harwich&mdash;I remember now. Where is my dressing-bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here by the side of your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my pocket-book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is on your dressing-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have any of my things been looked at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only so far as was necessary to discover your identity,&rdquo; the doctor
      assured him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk too much. The nurse is bringing you some beef
      tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster enquired, &ldquo;shall I be able to continue my journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon many things,&rdquo; the doctor replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster drank his beef tea and felt considerably stronger. His head
      still ached, but his memory was returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a young man in the carriage with me,&rdquo; he asked presently. &ldquo;Mr.
      Gerald something or other I think he said his name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fentolin,&rdquo; the doctor said. &ldquo;He is unhurt. This is his relative&rsquo;s house
      to which you have been brought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster lay for a time with knitted brows. Once more the name of
      Fentolin seemed somehow familiar to him, seemed somehow to bring with it
      to his memory a note of warning. He looked around the room fretfully. He
      looked into the nurse&rsquo;s face, which he disliked exceedingly, and he looked
      at the doctor, whom he was beginning to detest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose house exactly is this?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is St. David&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;the home of Mr. Miles Fentolin,&rdquo; the
      doctor told him. &ldquo;The young gentleman with whom you were travelling is his
      nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I send a telegram?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster asked, a little abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; the doctor replied. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin desired me to ask you
      if there was any one whom you would like to apprise of your safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the man upon the bed lay quite still, with knitted brows. There was
      surely something familiar about that name. Was it his fevered fancy or was
      there also something a little sinister?
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, who had glided from the room, came back presently with some
      telegraph forms. Mr. Dunster held out his hand for them and then
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me any date, Doctor, upon which I can rely upon leaving
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will probably be well enough to travel on the third day from now,&rdquo;
       the doctor assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The third day,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster muttered. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote out three telegrams and passed them over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to New York, one to The Hague, and one to London.
      There was plenty of money in my pocket. Perhaps you will find it and pay
      for these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything more,&rdquo; the doctor asked, &ldquo;that can be done for your
      comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster replied. &ldquo;My head aches now, but I think
      that I shall want to leave before three days are up. Are you the doctor in
      the neighbourhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarson shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am physician to Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s household,&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;I live
      here. Mr. Fentolin is himself somewhat of an invalid and requires constant
      medical attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster contemplated the speaker steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am an American and I am used to plain
      speech. I am quite unused to being attended by strange doctors. I
      understand that you are not in general practice now. Might I ask if you
      are fully qualified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an M.D. of London,&rdquo; the doctor replied. &ldquo;You can make yourself quite
      easy as to my qualifications. It would not suit Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s purpose to
      entrust himself to the care of any one without a reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room, and Mr. Dunster closed his eyes. His slumbers, however,
      were not altogether peaceful ones. All the time there seemed to be a
      hammering inside his head, and from somewhere back in his obscured memory
      the name of Fentolin seemed to be continually asserting itself. From
      somewhere or other, the amazing sense which sometimes gives warning of
      danger to men of adventure, seemed to have opened its feelers. He rested
      because he was exhausted, but even in his sleep he was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, with the telegrams in his hand, made his way down a splendid
      staircase, past the long picture gallery where masterpieces of Van Dyck
      and Rubens frowned and leered down upon him; descended the final stretch
      of broad oak stairs, crossed the hall, and entered his master&rsquo;s rooms. Mr.
      Fentolin was sitting before the open window, an easel in front of him, a
      palette in his left hand, painting with deft, swift touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, without looking around, &ldquo;it is my friend the doctor,
      my friend Sarson, M.D. of London, L.R.C.P. and all the rest of it. He
      brings with him the odour of the sick room. For a moment or two, just for
      a moment, dear friend, do not disturb me. Do not bring any alien thoughts
      into my brain. I am absorbed, you see&mdash;absorbed. It is a strange
      problem of colour, this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for several moments, glancing repeatedly out of the window
      and back to his canvas, painting all the time with swift and delicate
      precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins, who stands behind my chair,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;even
      Meekins is entranced. He has a soul, my friend Sarson, although you might
      not think it. He, too, sees sometimes the colour in the skies, the glitter
      upon the sands, the clear, sweet purity of those long stretches of virgin
      water. Meekins, I believe, has a soul, only he likes better to see these
      things grow under his master&rsquo;s touch than to wander about and solve their
      riddles for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man remained perfectly immovable. Not a feature twitched. Yet it was a
      fact that, although he stood where Mr. Fentolin could not possibly observe
      him, he never removed his gaze from the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my medical friend, that there has been a great tide in the
      night, following upon the flood? Even our small landmarks are shifted.
      Soon, in my little carriage, I shall ride down to the Tower. I shall sit
      there, and I shall watch the sea. I think that this evening, with the turn
      of the tide, the spray may reach even to my windows there. I shall paint
      again. There is always something fresh in the sea, you know&mdash;always
      something fresh in the sea. Like a human face&mdash;angry or pleased,
      sullen or joyful. Some people like to paint the sea at its calmest and
      most beautiful. Some people like to see happy faces around them. It is not
      every one who appreciates the other things. It is not quite like that with
      me, eh, Sarson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand fell to his side. Momentarily he had finished his work. He turned
      around and eyed the doctor, who stood in taciturn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer. Answer me,&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s gloomy face seemed darker still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have spoken the truth, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You are not one
      of the vulgar herd who love to consort with pleasure and happiness. You
      are one of those who understand the beauty of unhappiness&mdash;in
      others,&rdquo; he added, with faint emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled. His face became almost like the face of one of those
      angels of the great Italian master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you know me!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;My humble effort, Doctor&mdash;how
      do you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bent over the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about art,&rdquo; he said, a little roughly. &ldquo;Your work seems to
      me clever&mdash;a little grotesque, perhaps; a little straining after the
      hard, plain things which threaten. Nothing of the idealist in your work,
      Mr. Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin studied the canvas himself for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever man, Sarson,&rdquo; he remarked coolly, &ldquo;but no courtier. Never mind,
      my work pleases me. It gives me a passing sensation of happiness. Now,
      what about our patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He recovers,&rdquo; the doctor pronounced. &ldquo;From my short examination, I should
      say that he had the constitution of an ox. I have told him that he will be
      up in three days. As a matter of fact, he will be able, if he wants to, to
      walk out of the house to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot spare him quite so soon,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We must avail ourselves
      of this wonderful chance afforded us by my brilliant young nephew. We must
      keep him with us for a little time. What is it that you have in your
      hands, Doctor? Telegrams, I think. Let me look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor held them out. Mr. Fentolin took them eagerly between his thin,
      delicate fingers. Suddenly his face darkened, and became like the face of
      a spoilt and angry child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cipher!&rdquo; he exclaimed furiously. &ldquo;A cipher which he knows so well as to
      remember it, too! Never mind, it will be easy to decode. It will amuse me
      during the afternoon. Very good, Sarson. I will take charge of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not wish anything dispatched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin sighed. &ldquo;It will be well, I think, for
      the poor man to remain undisturbed by any communications from his friends.
      Is he restless at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to get on with his journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked. &ldquo;Now feel my pulse, Sarson. How am
      I this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor held the thin wrist for a moment between his fingers, and let
      it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In perfect health, as usual,&rdquo; he announced grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you cannot be sure!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin protested. &ldquo;My tongue, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make quite certain,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued. &ldquo;There are so many
      people who would miss me. My place in the world would not be easily filed.
      Undo my waistcoat, Sarson. Feel my heart, please. Feel carefully. I can
      see the end of your stethoscope in your pocket. Don&rsquo;t scamp it. I fancied
      this morning, when I was lying here alone, that there was something almost
      like a palpitation&mdash;a quicker beat. Be very careful, Sarson. Now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made his examination with impassive face. Then he stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no change in your condition, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The
      palpitation you spoke of is a mistake. You are in perfect health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will now amuse myself by a gentle ride down to the
      Tower. You are entirely satisfied, Sarson? You are keeping nothing back
      from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at him with grim, impassive face. &ldquo;There is nothing to
      keep back,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You have the constitution of a cowboy. There is
      no reason why you should not live for another thirty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed, as though a weight had been removed from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will now,&rdquo; he decided, reaching forward for the handle of his carriage,
      &ldquo;go down to the Tower. It is just possible that a few days&rsquo; seclusion
      might be good for our guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned silently away. There was no one there to see his
      expression as he walked towards the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two men who were supping together in the grillroom at the Cafe Milan
      were talking with a seriousness which seemed a little out of keeping with
      the rose-shaded lamps and the swaying music of the band from the distant
      restaurant. Their conversation had started some hours before in the club
      smoking-room and had continued intermittently throughout the evening. It
      had received a further stimulus when Richard Hamel, who had bought an
      Evening Standard on their way from the theatre a few minutes ago, came
      across a certain paragraph in it which he read aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I understand things over here, nowadays, Reggie!&rdquo; he declared,
      laying the paper down. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another Englishman imprisoned in Germany&mdash;this
      time at a place no one ever heard of before. I won&rsquo;t try to pronounce it.
      What does it all mean? It&rsquo;s all very well to shrug your shoulders, but
      when there are eighteen arrests within one week on a charge of espionage,
      there must be something up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Reginald Kinsley seemed inclined to discuss the subject
      seriously. He drew the paper towards him and read the little paragraph,
      word by word. Then he gave some further order to an attentive maitre
      d&rsquo;hotel and glanced around to be sure that they were not overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Dick, old chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are just back from abroad and
      you are not quite in the hang of things yet. Let me ask you a plain
      question. What do you think of us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of you?&rdquo; Hamel repeated, a little doubtfully. &ldquo;Do you mean
      personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it any way you like,&rdquo; Kinsley replied. &ldquo;Look at me. Nine years ago
      we played cricket in the same eleven. I don&rsquo;t look much like cricket now,
      do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at his companion thoughtfully. For a man who was doubtless
      still young, Kinsley had certainly an aged appearance. The hair about his
      temples was grey; there were lines about his mouth and forehead. He had
      the air of one who lived in an atmosphere of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; Hamel declared frankly, &ldquo;you look worried. If I hadn&rsquo;t heard so
      much of the success of your political career and all the rest of it, I
      should have thought that things were going badly with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone well enough with me personally,&rdquo; Kinsley admitted, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
      only one of many. Politics isn&rsquo;t the game it was. The Foreign Office
      especially is ageing its men fast these few years. We&rsquo;ve been going
      through hell, Hamel, and we are up against it now, hard up against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight smile passed from the lips of Hamel&rsquo;s sunburnt, good-natured
      face. He himself seemed to become infected with something of his
      companion&rsquo;s anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing seriously wrong, is there, Reggie?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Kinsley, with a sigh, &ldquo;I am afraid there is. It&rsquo;s very seldom
      I talk as plainly as this to any one but you are just the person one can
      unburden oneself to a little; and to tell you the truth, it&rsquo;s rather a
      relief. As you say, these eighteen arrests in one week do mean something.
      Half of the Englishmen who have been arrested are, to my certain
      knowledge, connected with our Secret Service, and they have been arrested,
      in many cases, where there are no fortifications worth speaking of within
      fifty miles, on one pretext or another. The fact of the matter is that
      things are going on in Germany, just at the present moment, the knowledge
      of which is of vital interest to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then these arrests,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;are really bona fide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; his companion agreed. &ldquo;I only wonder there have not
      been more. I am telling you what is a pretty open secret when I tell you
      that there is a conference due to be held this week at some place or
      another on the continent&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where, myself&mdash;which will
      have a very important bearing upon our future. We know just as much as
      that and not much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conference between whom?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley dropped his voice almost to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that a very great man from Russia, a greater still
      from France, a minister from Austria, a statesman from Italy, and an envoy
      from Japan, have been invited to meet a German minister whose name I will
      not mention, even to you. The subject of their proposed discussion has
      never been breathed. One can only suspect. When I tell you that no one
      from this country was invited to the conference, I think you will be able,
      broadly speaking, to divine its purpose. The clouds have been gathering
      for a good many years, and we have only buried our heads a little deeper
      in the sands. We have had our chances and wilfully chucked them away.
      National Service or three more army corps four years ago would have
      brought us an alliance which would have meant absolute safety for
      twenty-one years. You know what happened. We have lived through many
      rumours and escaped, more narrowly than most people realise, a great many
      dangers, but there is every indication this time that the end is really
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will the end be?&rdquo; Hamel enquired eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley shrugged his shoulders and paused while their glasses were filled
      with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be in the nature of a diplomatic coup,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;Of
      that much I feel sure. England will be forced into such a position that
      she will have no alternative left but to declare war. That, of course,
      will be the end of us. With our ridiculously small army and absolutely no
      sane scheme for home defence, we shall lose all that we have worth
      fighting for&mdash;our colonies&mdash;without being able to strike a blow.
      The thing is so ridiculously obvious. It has been admitted time after time
      by every sea lord and every commander-in-chief. We have listened to it,
      and that&rsquo;s all. Our fleet is needed under present conditions to protect
      our own shores. There isn&rsquo;t a single battleship which could be safely
      spared. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, India, must take care of
      themselves. I wonder when a nation of the world ever played fast and loose
      with great possessions as we have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a nice sort of thing to hear almost one&rsquo;s first night in
      England,&rdquo; Hamel remarked a little gloomily. &ldquo;Tell me some more about this
      conference. Are you sure that your information is reliable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our information is miserably scanty,&rdquo; Kinsley admitted. &ldquo;Curiously
      enough, the man who must know most about the whole thing is an Englishman,
      one of the most curious mortals in the British Empire. A spy of his
      succeeded in learning more than any of our people, and without being
      arrested, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is this singular person?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of whom you, I suppose, never heard,&rdquo; Kinsley replied. &ldquo;His name is
      Fentolin&mdash;Miles Fentolin&mdash;and he lives somewhere down in
      Norfolk. He is one of the strangest characters that ever lived, stranger
      than any effort of fiction I ever met with. He was in the Foreign Office
      once, and every one was predicting for him a brilliant career. Then there
      was an accident&mdash;let me see, it must have been some six or seven
      years ago&mdash;and he had to have both his legs amputated. No one knows
      exactly how the accident happened, and there was always a certain amount
      of mystery connected with it. Since then he has buried himself in the
      country. I don&rsquo;t think, in fact, that he ever moves outside his place; but
      somehow or other he has managed to keep in touch with all the political
      movements of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fentolin,&rdquo; Hamel repeated softly to himself. &ldquo;Tell me, whereabouts does
      he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a wonderful place in Norfolk, I believe, somewhere near the sea.
      I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name, for the moment. He has had wireless telegraphy
      installed; he has a telegraph office in the house, half-a-dozen private
      wires, and they say that he spends an immense amount of money keeping in
      touch with foreign politics. His excuse is that he speculates largely, as
      I dare say he does; but just lately,&rdquo; Kinsley went on more slowly, &ldquo;he has
      been an object of anxiety to all of us. It was he who sent the first agent
      out to Germany, to try and discover at least where this conference was to
      be held. His man returned in safety, and he has one over there now who has
      not been arrested. We seem to have lost nearly all of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that this man Fentolin actually possesses information
      which the Government hasn&rsquo;t as to the intentions of foreign Powers?&rdquo; Hamel
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley nodded. There was a slight flush upon his pallid cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He not only has it, but he doesn&rsquo;t mean to part with it. A few hundred
      years ago, when the rulers of this country were men with blood in their
      veins, he&rsquo;d have been given just one chance to tell all he knew, and hung
      as a traitor if he hesitated. We don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing nowadays. We
      rather go in for preserving traitors. We permit them even in our own House
      of Commons. However, I don&rsquo;t want to depress you and play the alarmist so
      soon after your return to London. I dare say the old country&rsquo;ll muddle
      along through our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; Hamel begged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other subject of
      conversation could interest me half as much. Have you formed any idea
      yourself as to the nature of this conference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all have an idea,&rdquo; Kinsley replied grimly; &ldquo;India for Russia; a large
      slice of China for Japan, with probably Australia thrown in;
      Alsace-Lorraine for France&rsquo;s neutrality. There&rsquo;s bribery for you. What&rsquo;s
      to become of poor England then? Our friends are only human, after all, and
      it&rsquo;s merely a question of handing over to them sufficient spoil. They must
      consider themselves first: that&rsquo;s the first duty of their politicians
      towards their country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; Hamel asked, &ldquo;that you seriously believe that a
      conference is on the point of being held at which France and Russia are to
      be invited to consider suggestions like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; Kinsley declared. &ldquo;Their
      ambassadors in London profess to know nothing. That, of course, is their
      reasonable attitude, but there&rsquo;s no doubt whatever that the conference has
      been planned. I should say that to-night we are nearer war, if we can
      summon enough spirit to fight, than we have been since Fashoda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer if I have returned just in time for the scrap,&rdquo; Hamel remarked
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;I was in the Militia once, so I expect I can get a job, if
      there&rsquo;s any fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get you a better job than fighting&mdash;one you can start on
      to-morrow, too,&rdquo; Kinsley announced abruptly, &ldquo;that is if you really want
      to help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Hamel insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that you are entirely your own master for the next six months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or as much longer as I like,&rdquo; Hamel assented. &ldquo;No plans at all, except
      that I might drift round to the Norfolk coast and look up some of the
      places where the governor used to paint. There&rsquo;s a queer little house&mdash;St.
      David&rsquo;s Tower, I believe they call it&mdash;which really belongs to me. It
      was given to my father, or rather he bought it, from a man who I think
      must have been some relative of your friend. I feel sure the name was
      Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Kinsley set down his wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your St. David&rsquo;s Tower anywhere near a place called Salthouse?&rdquo; he
      asked reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name of the village,&rdquo; Hamel admitted. &ldquo;My father used to spend
      quite a lot of time in those parts, and painted at least a dozen pictures
      down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a coincidence,&rdquo; Reginald Kinsley declared, lighting a cigarette.
      &ldquo;I think, if I were you, Dick, I&rsquo;d go down and claim my property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of me already?&rdquo; Hamel asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Kinsley knocked the ash from his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. The fact is, that job I was speaking to you about was
      simply this. We want some one to go down to Salthouse&mdash;not exactly as
      a spy, you know, but some one who has his wits about him. We are all of us
      very curious about this man Fentolin. There are no end of rumours which I
      won&rsquo;t mention to you, for they might only put you off the scent. But the
      man seems to be always intriguing. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if he were
      our friend, or if he were simply a financier, but to tell you the truth,
      we have cause to suspect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s an Englishman, surely?&rdquo; Hamel asked. &ldquo;The Fentolin who was my
      father&rsquo;s friend was just a very wealthy Norfolk squire&mdash;one of the
      best, from all I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles Fentolin is an Englishman,&rdquo; Kinsley admitted. &ldquo;It is true, too,
      that he comes of a very ancient Norfolk family. It doesn&rsquo;t do, however, to
      build too much upon that. From all I can learn of him, he is a sort of
      Puck, a professional mischief-maker. I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s anything an
      outsider could find out which would be really useful to us, but all the
      same, if I had the time, I should certainly go down to Norfolk myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation drifted away for a while. Mutual acquaintances entered,
      there were several introductions, and it was not until the two found
      themselves together in Kinsley&rsquo;s rooms for a few minutes before parting
      that they were alone again. Hamel returned then once more to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reggie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you think it would be of the slightest use, I&rsquo;ll go
      down to Salthouse to-morrow. I am rather keen on going there, anyway. I am
      absolutely fed up with life here already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what I want you to do,&rdquo; Kinsley said. &ldquo;I am afraid Fentolin is
      a little too clever for you to get on the right side of him, but if you
      could only get an idea as to what his game is down there, it would be a
      great help. You see, the fellow can&rsquo;t have gone into all this sort of
      thing blindfold. We&rsquo;ve lost several very useful agents abroad and two from
      New York who&rsquo;ve gone into his pay. There must be a method in it somewhere.
      If it really ends with his financial operations&mdash;why, all right.
      That&rsquo;s very likely what it&rsquo;ll come to, but we should like to know. The
      merest hint would be useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Hamel promised. &ldquo;In any case, it will be just the few
      days&rsquo; holiday I was looking forward to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley helped himself to whisky and soda and turned towards his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck to you, Dick! Take care of yourself. All sorts of things may
      happen, you know. Old man Fentolin may take a fancy to you and tell you
      secrets that any statesman in Europe would be glad to hear. He may tell
      you why this conference is being held and what the result will be. You may
      be the first to hear of our coming fall. Well, here&rsquo;s to you, anyway! Drop
      me a line, if you&rsquo;ve anything to report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheero!&rdquo; Hamel answered, as he set down his empty tumbler. &ldquo;Astonishing
      how keen I feel about this little adventure. I&rsquo;m perfectly sick of the
      humdrum life I have been leading the last week, and you do sort of take
      one back to the Arabian Nights, you know, Reggie. I am never quite sure
      whether to take you seriously or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley smiled as he held his friend&rsquo;s hand for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;if only you&rsquo;d believe it, the adventures in
      the Arabian Nights were as nothing compared with the present-day drama of
      foreign politics. You see, we&rsquo;ve learned to conceal things nowadays&mdash;to
      smooth them over, to play the part of ordinary citizens to the world while
      we tug at the underhand levers in our secret moments. Good night! Good
      luck!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Richard Hamel, although he certainly had not the appearance of a person
      afflicted with nerves, gave a slight start. For the last half-hour, during
      which time the train had made no stop, he had been alone in his
      compartment. Yet, to his surprise, he was suddenly aware that the seat
      opposite to him had been noiselessly taken by a girl whose eyes, also,
      were fixed with curious intentness upon the broad expanse of marshland and
      sands across which the train was slowly making its way. Hamel had spent a
      great many years abroad, and his first impulse was to speak with the
      unexpected stranger. He forgot for a moment that he was in England,
      travelling in a first-class carriage, and pointed with his left hand
      towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer country this, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he remarked pleasantly. &ldquo;Do you know, I
      never heard you come in. It gave me quite a start when I found that I had
      a fellow-passenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a certain amount of still surprise, a look which he
      returned just as steadfastly, because even in those few seconds he was
      conscious of that strange selective interest, certainly unaccounted for by
      his own impressions of her appearance. She seemed to him, at that first
      glance, very far indeed from being good-looking, according to any of the
      standards by which he had measured good looks. She was thin, too thin for
      his taste, and she carried herself with an aloofness to which he was
      unaccustomed. Her cheeks were quite pale, her hair of a soft shade of
      brown, her eyes grey and sad. She gave him altogether an impression of
      colourlessness, and he had been living in a land where colour and vitality
      meant much. Her speech, too, in its very restraint, fell strangely upon
      his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been travelling in an uncomfortable compartment,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;I
      happened to notice, when passing along the corridor, that yours was empty.
      In any case, I am getting out at the next station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he replied, still cheerfully. &ldquo;I suppose the next station is
      St. David&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but so far as her expression counted for anything at
      all, she was a little surprised. Her eyes considered him for a moment.
      Hamel was tall, well over six feet, powerfully made, with good features,
      clear eyes, and complexion unusually sunburnt. He wore a flannel collar of
      unfamiliar shape, and his clothes, although they were neat enough, were of
      a pattern and cut obviously designed to afford the maximum of ease and
      comfort with the minimum regard to appearance. He wore, too, very thick
      boots, and his hands gave one the impression that they were seldom gloved.
      His voice was pleasant, and he had the easy self-confidence of a person
      sure of himself in the world. She put him down as a colonial&mdash;perhaps
      an American&mdash;but his rank in life mystified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems the queerest stretch of country,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;long spits of
      sand jutting right out into the sea, dikes and creeks&mdash;miles and
      miles of them. Now, I wonder, is it low tide or high? Low, I should think,
      because of the sea-shine on the sand there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tide,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;is almost at its lowest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live in this neighbourhood, perhaps?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sort of country one might get very fond of,&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him from the depths of her grey eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she rejoined coldly. &ldquo;For my part, I hate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised at the unexpected emphasis of her tone&mdash;the first
      time, indeed, that she had shown any signs of interest in the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of dull I suppose you find it,&rdquo; he remarked pensively, looking out
      across the waste of lavender-grown marshes, sand hummocks piled with
      seaweed, and a far distant line of pebbled shore. &ldquo;And yet, I don&rsquo;t know.
      I have lived by the sea a good deal, and however monotonous it may seem at
      first, there&rsquo;s always plenty of change, really. Tide and wind do such
      wonderful work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, too, was looking out now towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t exactly that,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I am quite willing to
      admit what all the tourists and chance visitors call the fascination of
      these places. I happen to dislike them, that is all. Perhaps it is because
      I live here, because I see them day by day; perhaps because the sight of
      them and the thought of them have become woven into my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was talking half to herself. For a moment, even the knowledge of his
      presence had escaped her. Hamel, however, did not realise that fact. He
      welcomed her confidence as a sign of relaxation from the frigidity of her
      earlier demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems hard,&rdquo; he observed sympathetically. &ldquo;It seems odd to hear you
      talk like that, too. Your life, surely, ought to be pleasant enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked away from the sea into his face. Although the genuine interest
      which she saw there and the kindly expression of his eyes disarmed
      annoyance, she still stiffened slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was a little bewildering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because you are young and a girl,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural to be
      cheerful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she answered listlessly. &ldquo;I cannot tell. I have not had much
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it certainly seemed as though her reply would contain some
      rebuke for his curiosity. She glanced once more into his face, however,
      and the instinctive desire to administer that well-deserved snub passed
      away. He was so obviously interested, his question was asked so naturally,
      that its spice of impertinence was as though it had not existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-one,&rdquo; she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long have you lived here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I left boarding-school, four years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere near where I am going to bury myself for a time, I wonder?&rdquo; he
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Our only neighbours are the Lorneybrookes of
      Market Burnham. Are you going there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little shanty of my own,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;quite close to St.
      David&rsquo;s Station. I&rsquo;ve never even seen it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She vouchsafed some slight show of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this shanty, as you call it?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am looking for it
      now. All I can tell you is that it stands just out of reach of the full
      tides, on a piece of rock, dead on the beach and about a mile from the
      station. It was built originally for a coastguard station and meant to
      hold a lifeboat, but they found they could never launch the lifeboat when
      they had it, so the man to whom all the foreshore and most of the land
      around here belongs&mdash;a Mr. Fentolin, I believe&mdash;sold it to my
      father. I expect the place has tumbled to pieces by this time, but I
      thought I&rsquo;d have a look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gazing at him steadfastly now, with parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repeated it lingeringly. It seemed quite unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your father a great friend of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s, then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, in a sort of way,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My father was Hamel the
      artist, you know. They made him an R.A. some time before he died. He used
      to come out here and live in a tent. Then Mr. Fentolin let him use this
      place and finally sold it to him. My father used often to speak to me
      about it before he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she enquired, &ldquo;I do not know much about these matters, but have
      you any papers to prove that it was sold to your father and that you have
      the right to occupy it now when you choose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, as none of us
      have been here for so long, I thought I&rsquo;d better bring the title-deed, or
      whatever they call it, along with me. It&rsquo;s with the rest of my traps at
      Norwich. Oh, the place belongs to me, right enough!&rdquo; he went on, smiling.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that any one&rsquo;s pulled it down, or that it&rsquo;s disappeared
      from the face of the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it still remains there. When we are round the next curve,
      I think I can show it to you. But every one has forgotten, I think, that
      it doesn&rsquo;t belong to Mr. Fentolin still. He uses it himself very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her questioner quite steadfastly, quite quietly,
      speechlessly. A curious uneasiness crept into his thoughts. There were
      mysterious things in her face. He knew from that moment that she, too,
      directly or indirectly, was concerned with those strange happenings at
      which Kinsley had hinted. He knew that there were things which she was
      keeping from him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin uses one of the rooms as a studio. He likes to paint there
      and be near the sea,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But for the rest, I do not know. I
      never go near the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he remarked, after a few moments of silence, &ldquo;that I shall
      be a little unpopular with Mr. Fentolin. Perhaps I ought to have written
      first, but then, of course, I had no idea that any one was making use of
      the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how you can possibly expect to come down
      like this and live there, without any preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any servants nor any furniture nor things to cook with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am an old campaigner,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I meant to pick up a few
      oddments in the village. I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall stay very long, anyhow,
      but I thought I&rsquo;d like to have a look at the place. By-the-by, what sort
      of a man is Mr. Fentolin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was that curious expression in her eyes, an expression almost
      of secret terror, this time not wholly concealed. He could have sworn that
      her hands were cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He met with an accident many years ago,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Both his legs
      were amputated. He spends his life in a little carriage which he wheels
      about himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; Hamel exclaimed, with a strong man&rsquo;s ready sympathy for
      suffering. &ldquo;That is just as much as I have heard about him. Is he a decent
      sort of fellow in other ways? I suppose, anyhow, if he has really taken a
      fancy to my little shanty, I shall have to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as it seemed to him, for the first time real life leaped into her
      face. She leaned towards him. Her tone was half commanding, half
      imploring, her manner entirely confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It is yours. Claim it. Live in it. Do anything you
      like with it, but take it away from Mr. Fentolin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel was speechless. He sat a little forward, a hand on either knee, his
      mouth ungracefully open, an expression of blank and utter bewilderment in
      his face. For the first time he began to have vague doubts concerning this
      young lady. Everything about her had been so strange: her quiet entrance
      into the carriage, her unusual manner of talking, and finally this last
      passionate, inexplicable appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand. You say the
      poor fellow has taken a fancy to the place and likes being there. Well, it
      isn&rsquo;t much of a catch for me, anyway. I&rsquo;m rather a wanderer, and I dare
      say I shan&rsquo;t be back in these parts again for years. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I let
      him have it if he wants it? It&rsquo;s no loss to me. I&rsquo;m not a painter, you
      know, like my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed on the point of making a further appeal. Her lips, even, were
      parted, her head a little thrown back. And then she stopped. She said
      nothing. The silence lasted so long that he became almost embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me if I am a little dense, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;To
      tell you the truth,&rdquo; he went on, smiling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a sort of feeling that
      I&rsquo;d like to do anything you ask me. Now won&rsquo;t you just explain a little
      more clearly what you mean, and I&rsquo;ll blow up the old place sky high, if
      it&rsquo;s any pleasure to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed suddenly to have reverted to her former self&mdash;the cold and
      colourless young woman who had first taken the seat opposite to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine was a very foolish request,&rdquo; she admitted quietly. &ldquo;I am sorry that
      I ever made it. It was just an impulse, because the little building we
      were speaking of has been connected with one or two very disagreeable
      episodes. Nevertheless, it was foolish of me. How long did you think of
      staying there&mdash;that is,&rdquo; she added, with a faint smile, &ldquo;providing
      that you find it possible to prove your claim and take up possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just for a week or so,&rdquo; he answered lightly, &ldquo;and as to regaining
      possession of it,&rdquo; he went on, a slightly pugnacious instinct stirring
      him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine that there&rsquo;ll be any difficulty about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I want to make myself disagreeable,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but the
      Tower is mine, right enough, even if I have let it remain unoccupied for
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let down the window&mdash;a task in which he hastened to assist her. A
      rush of salt, cold air swept into the compartment. He sniffed it eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out a long arm and pointed. Away in the distance, on the
      summit of a line of pebbled shore, standing, as it seemed, sheer over the
      sea, was a little black speck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He changed his position and leaned out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a queer little place,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look worth
      quarrelling over, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she went on, directing his attention to the hill, &ldquo;is Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s home, St. David&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For several moments he made no remark at all. There was something
      curiously impressive in that sudden sweep up from the sea-line; the
      strange, miniature mountain standing in the middle of the marshes, with
      its tree-crowned background; and the long, weather-beaten front of the
      house turned bravely to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anything like it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s barely a quarter
      of a mile from the sea, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little more than that. It is a strangely situated abode, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he agreed, with emphasis. &ldquo;I must study the geological
      formation of that hill,&rdquo; he continued, with interest. &ldquo;Why, it looks
      almost like an island now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because of the floods,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Even at high tide the
      creeks never reach so far as the back there. All the water you see
      stretching away inland is flood water&mdash;the result of the storm, I
      suppose. This is where you get out,&rdquo; she concluded, rising to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away with the slightest nod. A maid was already awaiting her at
      the door of the compartment. Hamel was suddenly conscious of the fact that
      he disliked her going immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall, perhaps, meet again during the next few days,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half turned her head. Her expression was scarcely encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you will not be disappointed in your quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel followed her slowly on to the platform, saw her escorted to a very
      handsome motor-car by an obsequious station-master, and watched the former
      disappear down the stretch of straight road which led to the hill. Then,
      with a stick in one hand, and the handbag which was his sole luggage in
      the other, he left the station and turned seaward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, surrounded by his satellites, was seated in his chair before
      the writing-table. There were present in the room most of the people
      important to him in his somewhat singular life. A few feet away, in
      characteristic attitude, stood Meekins. Doctor Sarson, with his hands
      behind him, was looking out of the window. At the further end of the table
      stood a confidential telegraph clerk, who was just departing with a little
      sheaf of messages. By his side, with a notebook in her hand, stood Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s private secretary&mdash;a white-haired woman, with a strangely
      transparent skin and light brown eyes, dressed in somber black, a woman
      who might have been of any age from thirty to fifty. Behind her was a
      middle-aged man whose position in the household no one was quite sure
      about&mdash;a clean-shaven man whose name was Ryan, and who might very
      well have been once an actor or a clergyman. In the background stood
      Henderson, the perfect butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps opportune,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said quietly, &ldquo;that you all whom I
      trust should be present here together. I wish you to understand one thing.
      You have, I believe, in my employ learned the gift of silence. It is to be
      exercised with regard to a certain visitor brought here by my nephew, a
      visitor whom I regret to say is now lying seriously ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was absolute silence. Doctor Sarson alone turned from the window as
      though about to speak, but met Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s eye and at once resumed his
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rely upon you all,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued softly. &ldquo;Henderson, you,
      perhaps, have the most difficult task, for you have the servants to
      control. Nevertheless, I rely upon you, also. If one word of this
      visitor&rsquo;s presence here leaks out even so far as the village, out they go,
      every one of them. I will not have a servant in the place who does not
      respect my wishes. You can give any reason you like for my orders. It is a
      whim. I have whims, and I choose to pay for them. You are all better paid
      than any man breathing could pay you. In return I ask only for your
      implicit obedience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand and took a cigarette from a curiously carved
      ivory box which stood by his side. He tapped it gently upon the table and
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; Henderson said respectfully, &ldquo;that I can answer for the
      servants. Being mostly foreigners, they see little or nothing of the
      village people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one else made any remark. It was strange to see how dominated they all
      were by that queer little fragment of humanity, whose head scarcely
      reached a foot above the table before which he sat. They departed
      silently, almost abjectly, dismissed with a single wave of the hand. Mr.
      Fentolin beckoned his secretary to remain. She came a little nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Lucy,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself a few feet away from him. Mr. Fentolin watched her for
      several moments. He himself had his back to the light. The woman, on the
      other hand, was facing it. The windows were high, and the curtains were
      drawn back to their fullest extent. A cold stream of northern light fell
      upon her face. Mr. Fentolin gazed at her and nodded his head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lucy,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you are wonderful&mdash;a perfect cameo, a
      gem. To look at you now, with your delightful white hair and your flawless
      skin, one would never believe that you had ever spoken a single angry
      word, that you had ever felt the blood flow through your veins, or that
      your eyes had ever looked upon the gentle things of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, still without speech. The immobility of her face was
      indeed a marvellous thing. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s expression darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he murmured softly, &ldquo;I think that if I had strong fingers&mdash;really
      strong fingers, you know, Lucy&mdash;I should want to take you by the
      throat and hold you tighter and tighter, until your breath came fast, and
      your eyes came out from their shadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned over a few pages of her notebook. To all appearance she had not
      heard a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;is the fourth of April. Shall I send out the
      various checks to those men in Paris, New York, Frankfort, St. Petersburg,
      and Tokio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can send the checks,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Be sure that you draw them, as
      usual, upon the Credit Lyonaise and in the name you know of. Say to
      Lebonaitre of Paris that you consider his last reports faulty. No mention
      was made of Monsieur C&rsquo;s visit to the Russian Embassy, or of the supper
      party given to the Baron von Erlstein by a certain Russian gentleman. Warn
      him, if you please, that reports with such omissions are useless to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote a few words in her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a note of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not make mistakes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyebrows were drawn together. This was his work, he told himself, this
      magnificent physical subjection. Yet his inability to stir her sometimes
      maddened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know who is in this house?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You know the name of my
      unknown guest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;His presence does not interest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing I desire you to know?&rdquo; he persisted, leaning a little forward.
      &ldquo;Supposing I tell you that it is your duty to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should tell you that I believe him to be the special
      envoy from New York to The Hague, or whatever place on the Continent this
      coming conference is to be held at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, woman!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin answered sharply. &ldquo;Right! It is the special
      envoy. He has his mandate with him. I have them both&mdash;the man and his
      mandate. Can you guess what I am going to do with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not difficult,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Your methods are scarcely original.
      His mandate to the flames, and his body to the sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes as she spoke and looked over Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s shoulder,
      across the marshland to the grey stretch of ocean. Her eyes became fixed.
      It was not possible to say that they held any expression, and yet one felt
      that she saw beneath the grey waves, even to the rocks and caverns below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not terrify you, then,&rdquo; he asked curiously, &ldquo;to think that a man
      under this roof is about to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Death does not frighten me&mdash;my own or
      anybody else&rsquo;s. Does it frighten you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was suddenly livid, his eyes full of fierce anger. His lips
      twitched. He struck the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast of a woman!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You ghoul! How dare you! How dare you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. He passed his hand across his forehead. All the time the
      woman remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he muttered, his voice still shaking a little, &ldquo;that I
      believe sometimes I am afraid of you? How would you like to see me there,
      eh, down at the bottom of that hungry sea? You watch sometimes so fixedly.
      You&rsquo;d miss me, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I am a good master, you know. I pay well.
      You&rsquo;ve been with me a good many years. You were a different sort of woman
      when you first came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;I was a different sort of woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember those days, I suppose,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the days when you
      had brown hair, when you used to carry roses about and sing to yourself
      while you beat your work out of that wretched typewriter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I do not remember those days. They do not belong to
      me. It is some other woman you are thinking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. Mr. Fentolin turned away first. He struck the bell at his
      elbow. She rose at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be off!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;When you look at me like that, you send shivers
      through me! You&rsquo;ll have to go; I can see you&rsquo;ll have to go. I can&rsquo;t keep
      you any longer. You are the only person on the face of the earth who dares
      to say things to me which make me think, the only person who doesn&rsquo;t
      shrink at the sound of my voice. You&rsquo;ll have to go. Send Sarson to me at
      once. You&rsquo;ve upset me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened to his words in expressionless silence. When he had finished,
      carrying her book in her hand, she very quietly moved towards the door. He
      watched her, leaning a little forward in his chair, his lips parted, his
      eyes threatening. She walked with steady, even footsteps. She carried
      herself with almost machine-like erectness; her skirts were noiseless. She
      had the trick of turning the handle of the door in perfect silence. He
      heard her calm voice in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Sarson is to go to Mr. Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat quite still, feeling his own pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;that&mdash;woman&mdash;some day I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. The doctor had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am upset, Sarson,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Come and feel my pulse quickly. That
      woman has upset me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Price, d&mdash;n it! Lucy&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems unlike her,&rdquo; the doctor remarked. &ldquo;I have never heard her utter
      a useless syllable in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin held out his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what she doesn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor produced his watch. In less than a minute he put it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is quite unnecessary,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;Your pulse is wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hurried? No signs of palpitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seven or eight footmen, all young men,&rdquo; Doctor Sarson replied
      drily. &ldquo;I will wager that there isn&rsquo;t one of them has a pulse so vigorous
      as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin leaned a little back in his chair. An expression of
      satisfaction crept over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You reassure me, my dear Sarson. That is excellent. What of our patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin sighed, &ldquo;that we shall have trouble with him.
      These strong people always give trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be just the same in the long run,&rdquo; the doctor remarked, shrugging
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin held up his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! A motor-car, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Miss Fentolin who is just arriving,&rdquo; the doctor announced. &ldquo;I saw
      the car coming as I crossed the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Indeed? So my dear niece has returned. Open the
      door, friend Sarson. Open the door, if you please. She will be anxious to
      see me. We must summon her.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin raised to his lips the little gold whistle which hung from
      his neck and blew it. He seemed to devote very little effort to the
      operation, yet the strength of the note was wonderful. As the echoes died
      away, he let it fall by his side and waited with a pleased smile upon his
      lips. In a few seconds there was the hurried flutter of skirts and the
      sound of footsteps. The girl who had just completed her railway journey
      entered, followed by her brother. They were both a little out of breath,
      they both approached the chair without a smile, the girl in advance, with
      a certain expression of apprehension in her eyes. Mr. Fentolin sighed. He
      appeared to notice these things and regret them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hands, &ldquo;my dear Esther, welcome home
      again! I heard the car outside. I am grieved that you did not at once
      hurry to my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been in the house two minutes,&rdquo; Esther replied, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t
      seen mother yet. Forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had come to a standstill a few yards away. She moved now very slowly
      towards the chair, with the air of one fulfilling a hateful task. The
      fingers which accepted his hands were extended almost hesitatingly. He
      drew her closer to him and held her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother, my dear Esther, is, I regret to say, suffering from a slight
      indisposition,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;She has been confined to her room for the
      last few days. Just a trifling affair of the nerves; nothing more, Doctor
      Sarson assures me. But my dear child,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;your fingers are as
      cold as ice. You look at me so strangely, too. Alas! you have not the
      affectionate disposition of your dear mother. One would scarcely believe
      that we have been parted for more than a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For more than a week,&rdquo; she repeated, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop down, my dear. I must kiss your forehead&mdash;there! Now bring up
      a chair to my side. You seem frightened&mdash;alarmed. Have you ill news
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no news,&rdquo; she answered, gradually recovering herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gaieties of London, I fear,&rdquo; he protested gently, &ldquo;have proved a
      little unsettling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were no gaieties for me,&rdquo; the girl replied bitterly. &ldquo;Mrs. Sargent
      obeyed your orders very faithfully. I was not allowed to move out except
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, you would not go about London unchaperoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a difference,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;between a chaperon and a jailer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed. He shook his head slowly. He seemed pained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that you repay my care as it deserves, Esther,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;There is something in your deportment which disappoints me.
      Never mind, your brother has made some atonement. I entrusted him with a
      little mission in which I am glad to say that he has been brilliantly
      successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say that I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; Esther replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat back in his chair. His long fingers played nervously
      together, he looked at her gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone of pained surprise, &ldquo;your
      attitude distresses me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it. I have told you what I think about Gerald and the life
      he is compelled to live here. I don&rsquo;t mind so much for myself, but for him
      I think it is abominable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as ever,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin sighed. &ldquo;I fear that this little change
      has done you no good, dear niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;It was only a change of prisons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head slowly&mdash;a distressful gesture. Yet all
      the time he had somehow the air of a man secretly gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beginning to depress me,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I think that you can go
      away. No, stop for just one moment. Stand there in the light. Dear me, how
      unfortunate! Who would have thought that so beautiful a mother could have
      so plain a daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood quite still before him, her hands crossed in front of her,
      something of the look of the nun from whom the power of suffering has gone
      in her still, cold face and steadfast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a touch of colour,&rdquo; he continued meditatively, &ldquo;a figure straight as
      my walking-stick. What a pity! And all the taste, nowadays, they tell me,
      is in the other direction. The lank damsels have gone completely out. We
      buried them with Oscar Wilde. Run along, my dear child. You do not amuse
      me. You can take Gerald with you, if you will. I have nothing to say to
      Gerald just now. He is in my good books. Is there anything I can do for
      you, Gerald? Your allowance, for instance&mdash;a trifling increase or an
      advance? I am in a generous humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then grant me what I begged for the other day,&rdquo; the boy answered quickly.
      &ldquo;Let me go to Sandhurst. I could enter my name next week for the
      examinations, and I could pass to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin tapped the table thoughtfully with his forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little ungrateful, my dear boy,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;a little ungrateful
      that, I think. Your confidence in yourself pleases me, though. You think
      you could pass your examinations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did a set of papers last week,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;On the given
      percentages I came out twelfth or better. Mr. Brown assured me that I
      could go in for them at any moment. He promised to write you about it
      before he left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to think of it, I did have a letter from Mr. Brown,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;Rather an impertinence for a tutor, I thought it. He devoted
      three pages towards impressing upon me the necessity of your adopting some
      sort of a career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote because he thought it was his duty,&rdquo; the boy said doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you want to be a soldier,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued musingly. &ldquo;Well,
      well, why not? Our picture galleries are full of them. There has been a
      Fentolin in every great battle for the last five hundred years. Sailors,
      too&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;and just a few diplomatists. Brave fellows!
      Not one, I fancy,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;like me&mdash;not one condemned to pass
      their days in a perambulator. You are a fine fellow, Gerald&mdash;a
      regular Fentolin. Getting on for six feet, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six feet two, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine fellow,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated. &ldquo;I am not so sure about the
      army, Gerald. You see, there are some people who say, like your American
      friend, that we are even now almost on the brink of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason for me to hurry,&rdquo; the boy begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Have you ever stopped to think what war means&mdash;the
      war you speak of so lightly? The suffering, the misery of it! All the
      pageantry and music and heroism in front; and behind, a blackened world, a
      trail of writhing corpses, a world of weeping women for whom the sun shall
      never rise again. Ugh! An ugly thing war, Gerald. I am not sure that you
      are not better at home here. Why not practise golf a little more
      assiduously? I see from the local paper that you are still playing at two
      handicap. Now with your physique, I should have thought you would have
      been a scratch player long before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I play cricket, sir,&rdquo; the boy reminded him, a little impatiently, &ldquo;and,
      after all, there are other things in the world besides games.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s long finger shot suddenly out. He was leaning a little from
      his chair. His expression of gentle immobility had passed away. His face
      was stern, almost stony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have spoken the truth, Gerald,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are other things in
      the world besides games. There is the real, the tragical side of life, the
      duties one takes up, the obligations of honour. You have not forgotten,
      young man, the burden you carry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was paler, but he had drawn himself to his full height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten, sir,&rdquo; he answered bitterly. &ldquo;Do I show any signs of
      forgetting? Haven&rsquo;t I done your bidding year by year? Aren&rsquo;t I here now to
      do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do it!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin retorted sharply. &ldquo;When I am ready for you to
      leave here, you shall leave. Until then, you are mine. Remember that. Ah!
      this is Doctor Sarson who comes, I believe. That must mean that it is five
      o&rsquo;clock. Come in, Doctor. I am not engaged. You see, I am alone with my
      dear niece and nephew. We have been having a little pleasant
      conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson bowed to Esther, who scarcely glanced at him. He remained in
      the background, quietly waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very delightful little conversation,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin concluded. &ldquo;I have
      been congratulating my nephew, Doctor, upon his wisdom in preferring the
      quiet country life down here to the wearisome routine of a profession. He
      escapes the embarrassing choice of a career by preferring to devote his
      life to my comfort. I shall not forget it. I shall not be ungrateful. I
      may have my faults, but I am not ungrateful. Run away now, both of you.
      Dear children you are, but one wearies, you know, of everything. I am
      going out. You see, the twilight is coming. The tide is changing. I am
      going down to meet the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His little carriage moved towards the door. The brother and sister passed
      out. Esther led Gerald into the great dining-room, and from there, through
      the open windows, out on to the terrace. She gripped his shoulder and
      pointed down to the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear, &ldquo;is going to happen there.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little station at which Hamel alighted was like an oasis in the middle
      of a flat stretch of sand and marsh. It consisted only of a few raised
      planks and a rude shelter&mdash;built, indeed, for the convenience of St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall alone, for the nearest village was two miles away. The
      station-master, on his return from escorting the young lady to her car,
      stared at this other passenger in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way to the sea?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man pointed to the white gates of the crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take any of those paths you like, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you want to
      get to Salthouse, though, you should have got out at the next station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do for me,&rdquo; Hamel replied cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful of the dikes,&rdquo; the station-master advised him. &ldquo;Some of them
      are pretty deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded, and passing through the white gates, made his way by a
      raised cattle track towards the sea. On either side of him flowed a narrow
      dike filled with salt-water. Beyond stretched the flat marshland, its
      mossy turf leavened with cracks and creeks of all widths, filled also with
      sea-slime and sea-water. A slight grey mist rested upon the more distant
      parts of the wilderness which he was crossing, a mist which seemed to be
      blown in from the sea in little puffs, resting for a time upon the earth,
      and then drifting up and fading away like soap bubbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once where the dikes had overflown he was compelled to change
      his course, but he arrived at last at the little ridge of pebbled beach
      bordering the sea. Straight ahead of him now was that strange-looking
      building towards which he had all the time been directing his footsteps.
      As he approached it, his forehead slightly contracted. There was ample
      confirmation before him of the truth of his fellow-passenger&rsquo;s words. The
      place, left to itself for so many years, without any attention from its
      actual owner, was neither deserted nor in ruins. Its solid grey stone
      walls were sea-stained and a trifle worn, but the arched wooden doors
      leading into the lifeboat shelter, which occupied one side of the
      building, had been newly painted, and in the front the window was hung
      with a curtain, now closely drawn, of some dark red material. The lock
      from the door had been removed altogether, and in its place was the
      aperture for a Yale latch-key. The last note of modernity was supplied by
      the telephone wire attached to the roof of the lifeboat shelter. He walked
      all round the building, seeking in vain for some other means of ingress.
      Then he stood for a few moments in front of the curtained window. He was a
      man of somewhat determined disposition, and he found himself vaguely
      irritated by the liberties which had been taken with his property. He
      hammered gently upon the framework with his fist, and the windows opened
      readily inwards, pushing back the curtain with them. He drew himself up on
      to the sill, and, squeezing himself through the opening, landed on his
      feet and looked around him, a little breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in a simply furnished man&rsquo;s sitting-room. An easel was
      standing close to the window. There were reams of drawing paper and
      several unfinished sketches leaning against the wall. There was a small
      oak table in the middle of the room; against the wall stood an exquisite
      chiffonier, on which were resting some cut-glass decanters and goblets.
      There was a Turkey carpet upon the floor which matched the curtains, but
      to his surprise there was not a single chair of any sort to be seen. The
      walls had been distempered and were hung with one or two engravings which,
      although he was no judge, he was quite sure were good. He wandered into
      the back room, where he found a stove, a tea-service upon a deal table,
      and several other cooking utensils, all spotlessly clean and of the most
      expensive description. The walls here were plainly whitewashed, and the
      floor was of hard stone. He then tried the door on the left, which led
      into the larger portion of the building&mdash;the shed in which the
      lifeboat had once been kept. Not only was the door locked, but he saw at
      once that the lock was modern, and the door itself was secured with heavy
      iron clamps. He returned to the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl with the grey eyes was right enough,&rdquo; he remarked to himself.
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin has been making himself very much at home with my property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew the curtains, noticing, to his surprise, the heavy shutters
      which their folds had partly concealed. Then he made his way out along the
      passage to the front door, which from the inside he was able to open
      easily enough. Leaving it carefully ajar, he went out with the intention
      of making an examination of the outside of the place. Instead, however, he
      paused at the corner of the building with his face turned landwards.
      Exactly fronting him now, about three-quarters of a mile away, on the
      summit of that strange hill which stood out like a gigantic rock in the
      wilderness, was St. David&rsquo;s Hall. He looked at it steadily and with
      increasing admiration. Its long, red brick front with its masses of
      clustering chimneys, a little bare and weather-beaten, impressed him with
      a sense of dignity due as much to the purity of its architecture as the
      singularity of its situation. Behind&mdash;a wonderfully effective
      background&mdash;were the steep gardens from which, even in this uncertain
      light, he caught faint glimpses of colouring subdued from brilliancy by
      the twilight. These were encircled by a brick wall of great height, the
      whole of the southern portion of which was enclosed with glass. From the
      fragment of rock upon which he had seated himself, to the raised stone
      terrace in front of the house, was an absolutely straight path,
      beautifully kept like an avenue, with white posts on either side, and
      built up to a considerable height above the broad tidal way which ran for
      some distance by its side. It had almost the appearance of a racing track,
      and its state of preservation in the midst of the wilderness was little
      short of remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Hamel said to himself, as he slowly produced a pipe from his
      pocket and began to fill it with tobacco from a battered silver box, &ldquo;is a
      queer fix. Looks rather like the inn for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who might you be, gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned abruptly around towards his unseen questioner. A woman was
      standing by the side of the rock upon which he was sitting, a woman from
      the village, apparently, who must have come with noiseless footsteps along
      the sandy way. She was dressed in rusty black, and in place of a hat she
      wore a black woolen scarf tied around her head and underneath her chin.
      Her face was lined, her hair of a deep brown plentifully besprinkled with
      grey. She had a curious habit of moving her lips, even when she was not
      speaking. She stood there smiling at him, but there was something about
      that smile and about her look which puzzled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just a visitor,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you come out of the Tower,&rdquo; she said, speaking with a strong local
      accent and yet with a certain unusual correctness, &ldquo;in at the window and
      out of the door. You&rsquo;re a brave man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why brave?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head very slowly towards St. David&rsquo;s Hall. A gleam of
      sunshine had caught one of the windows, which shone like fire. She pointed
      toward it with her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking at you,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t like strangers poking
      around here, that I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; Hamel enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Fentolin,&rdquo; she answered, dropping her voice a little. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very
      kind-hearted gentleman, Squire Fentolin, but he don&rsquo;t like strangers
      hanging around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am not exactly a stranger, you see,&rdquo; Hamel remarked. &ldquo;My father
      used to stay for months at a time in that little shanty there and paint
      pictures. It&rsquo;s a good many years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mind him,&rdquo; the woman said slowly. &ldquo;His name was Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his son,&rdquo; Hamel announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the Hall. &ldquo;Does he know that you are here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head. &ldquo;Not yet. I have been abroad for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly relapsed into her curious habit. Her lips moved, but no words
      came. She had turned her head a little and was facing the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Hamel asked gently, &ldquo;why do you come out here alone, so far
      from the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed with her finger to where the waves were breaking in a thin
      line of white, about fifty yards from the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cemetery, that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the village cemetery, you know. I
      have three buried there: George, the eldest; James, the middle one; and
      David, the youngest. Three of them&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I come. I can&rsquo;t put
      flowers on their graves, but I can sit and watch and look through the sea,
      down among the rocks where their bodies are, and wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at her curiously. Her voice had grown lower and lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you land folks don&rsquo;t believe, perhaps,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
      true. It&rsquo;s only us who live near the sea who understand it. I am not an
      ignorant body, either. I was schoolmistress here before I married David
      Cox. They thought I&rsquo;d done wrong to marry a fisherman, but I bore him
      brave sons, and I lived the life a woman craves for. No, I am not
      ignorant. I have fancies, perhaps&mdash;the Lord be praised for them!&mdash;and
      I tell you it&rsquo;s true. You look at a spot in the sea and you see nothing&mdash;a
      gleam of blue, a fleck of white foam, one day; a gleam of green with a
      black line, another; and a grey little sob, the next, perhaps. But you go
      on looking. You look day by day and hour by hour, and the chasms of the
      sea will open, and their voices will come to you. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clutched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you hear that?&rdquo; she half whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The light!&rsquo; It was David&rsquo;s voice! &lsquo;The light!&rsquo;&rdquo; Hamel was speechless.
      The woman&rsquo;s face was suddenly strangely transformed. Her mood, however,
      swiftly changed. She turned once more towards the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know him soon,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the kindest man in these parts, they
      say. It&rsquo;s not much that he gives away, but he&rsquo;s a kind heart. You see that
      great post at the entrance to the river there?&rdquo; she went on, pointing to
      it. &ldquo;He had that set up and a lamp hung from there. Fentolin&rsquo;s light, they
      call it. It was to save men&rsquo;s lives. It was burning, they say, the night I
      lost my lads. Fentolin&rsquo;s light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were wrecked?&rdquo; he asked her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrecked,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Bad steering it must have been. James would
      steer, and they say that he drank a bit. Bad steering! Yes, you&rsquo;ll meet
      Squire Fentolin before long. He&rsquo;s queer to look at&mdash;a small body but
      a great, kind heart. A miserable life, his, but it will be made up to him.
      It will be made up to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away. Her lips were moving all the time. She walked about a
      dozen steps, and then she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Hamel&rsquo;s son, the painter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be welcome down here.
      He&rsquo;ll have you to stay at the Hall&mdash;a brave place. Don&rsquo;t let him be
      too kind to you. Sometimes kindness hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed on, walking with a curious, shambling gait, and soon she
      disappeared on her way to the village. Hamel watched her for a moment and
      then turned his head towards St. David&rsquo;s Hall. He felt somehow that her
      abrupt departure was due to something which she had seen in that
      direction. He rose to his feet. His instinct had been a true one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      From where Hamel stood a queer object came strangely into sight. Below the
      terrace of St. David&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;from a spot, in fact, at the base of the
      solid wall&mdash;it seemed as though a gate had been opened, and there
      came towards him what he at first took to be a tricycle. As it came
      nearer, it presented even a weirder appearance. Mr. Fentolin, in a black
      cape and black skull cap, sat a little forward in his electric carriage,
      with his hand upon the guiding lever. His head came scarcely above the
      back of the little vehicle, his hands and body were motionless. He seemed
      to be progressing without the slightest effort, personal or mechanical, as
      though he rode, in deed, in some ghostly vehicle. From the same place in
      the wall had issued, a moment or two later, a man upon a bicycle, who was
      also coming towards him. Hamel was scarcely conscious of this secondary
      figure. His eyes were fixed upon the strange personage now rapidly
      approaching him. There was something which seemed scarcely human in that
      shrunken fragment of body, the pale face with its waving white hair, the
      strange expression with which he was being regarded. The little vehicle
      came to a standstill only a few feet away. Mr. Fentolin leaned forward.
      His features had lost their delicately benevolent aspect; his words were
      minatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am under the impression, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I saw you with my glasses
      from the window attempting to force an entrance into that building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not only tried but I succeeded,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I got in through the
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s eyes glittered for a moment. Hamel, who had resumed his
      place upon the rock close at hand, had been mixed up during his lifetime
      in many wild escapades. Yet at that moment he had a sudden feeling that
      there were dangers in life which as yet he had not faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask for your explanation or your excuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call it an explanation or an excuse, whichever you like,&rdquo; Hamel
      replied steadily, &ldquo;but the fact is that this little building, which some
      one else seems to have appropriated, is mine. If I had not been a
      good-natured person, I should be engaged, at the present moment, in
      turning out its furniture on to the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Hamel&mdash;Richard Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For several moments there was silence. Mr. Fentolin was still leaning
      forward in his strange little vehicle. The colour seemed to have left even
      his lips. The hard glitter in his eyes had given place to an expression
      almost like fear. He looked at Richard Hamel as though he were some
      strange sea-monster come up from underneath the sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Hamel,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you mean that you are the son of Hamel,
      the R.A., who used to be in these parts so often? He was my brother&rsquo;s
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his son was killed in the San Francisco earthquake. I saw his name in
      all the lists. It was copied into the local papers here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel knocked the ashes from his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take a lot of killing,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I was in that earthquake, right
      enough, and in the hospital afterwards, but it was a man named Hamel of
      Philadelphia who died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat quite motionless for several moments. He seemed, if
      possible, to have shrunken into something smaller still. A few yards
      behind, Meekins had alighted from his bicycle and was standing waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are Richard Hamel,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said at last very softly.
      &ldquo;Welcome back to England, Richard Hamel! I knew your father slightly,
      although we were never very friendly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand from underneath the coverlet of his little
      vehicle&mdash;a hand with long, white fingers, slim and white and shapely
      as a woman&rsquo;s. A single ring with a dull green stone was on his fourth
      finger. Hamel shook hands with him as he would have shaken hands with a
      woman. Afterwards he rubbed his fingers slowly together. There was
      something about the touch which worried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been making use of this little shanty, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded. He was apparently beginning to recover himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; he explained suavely, &ldquo;that it was built by my
      grandfather, and that we have had rights over the whole of the foreshore
      here from time immemorial. I know quite well that my brother gave it to
      your father&mdash;or rather he sold it to him for a nominal sum. I must
      tell you that it was a most complicated transaction. He had the greatest
      difficulty in getting any lawyer to draft the deed of sale. There were so
      many ancient rights and privileges which it was impossible to deal with.
      Even now there are grave doubts as to the validity of the transaction.
      When nothing was heard of you, and we all concluded that you were dead, I
      ventured to take back what I honestly believed to be my own. Owing,&rdquo; he
      continued slowly, &ldquo;to my unfortunate affliction, I am obliged to depend
      for interest in my life upon various hobbies. This little place, queerly
      enough, has become one of them. I have furnished it, in a way; installed
      the telephone to the house, connected it with my electric plant, and I
      come down here when I want to be quite alone, and paint. I watch the sea&mdash;such
      a sea sometimes, such storms, such colour! You notice that ridge of sand
      out yonder? It forms a sort of natural breakwater. Even on the calmest day
      you can trace that white line of foam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a strange coast,&rdquo; Hamel admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin pointed with his forefinger northwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about there,&rdquo; he indicated, &ldquo;is the entrance to the tidal river
      which flows up to the village of St. David&rsquo;s yonder. You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His finger traced its course until it came to a certain point near the
      beach, where a tall black pillar stood, surmounted by a globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a light fixed there for the benefit of the fishermen,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;a light which I work from my own dynamo. Between where we are
      sitting now and there&mdash;only a little way out to sea&mdash;is a jagged
      cluster of cruel rocks. You can see them if you care to swim out in calm
      weather. Fishermen who tried to come in by night were often trapped there
      and, in a rough sea, drowned. That is why I had that pillar of light
      built. On stormy nights it shows the exact entrance to the water
      causeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you indeed,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;very benevolent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So few people have any real feeling for sailors,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The
      fishermen around here are certainly rather a casual class. Do you know
      that there is scarcely one of them who can swim? There isn&rsquo;t one of them
      who isn&rsquo;t too lazy to learn even the simplest stroke. My brother used to
      say&mdash;dear Gerald&mdash;that it served them right if they were
      drowned. I have never been able to feel like that, Mr. Hamel. Life is such
      a wonderful thing. One night,&rdquo; he went on, dropping his voice and leaning
      a little forward in his carriage&mdash;&ldquo;it was just before, or was it just
      after I had fixed that light&mdash;I was down here one dark winter night.
      There was a great north wind and a huge sea running. It was as black as
      pitch, but I heard a boat making for St. David&rsquo;s causeway strike on those
      rocks just hidden in front there. I heard those fishermen shriek as they
      went under. I heard their shouts for help, I heard their death cries. Very
      terrible, Mr. Hamel! Very terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at the speaker curiously. Mr. Fentolin seemed absorbed in his
      subject. He had spoken with relish, as one who loves the things he speaks
      about. Quite unaccountably, Hamel found himself shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was their mother,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, leaning again a little
      forward in his chair, &ldquo;their mother whom I saw pass along the beach just
      now&mdash;a widow, too, poor thing. She comes here often&mdash;a morbid
      taste. She spoke to you, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spoke to me strangely,&rdquo; Hamel admitted. &ldquo;She gave me the impression
      of a woman whose brain had been turned with grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too true,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin sighed. &ldquo;The poor creature! I offered her a small
      pension, but she would have none of it. A superior woman in her way once,
      filled now with queer fancies,&rdquo; he went on, eyeing Hamel steadily,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      very strangest fancies. She spends her life prowling about here. No one in
      the village even knows how she lives. Did she speak of me, by-the-by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spoke of you as being a very kind-hearted man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor creature! Well, well, let us revert to the object of your coming
      here. Do you really wish to occupy this little shanty, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my idea,&rdquo; Hamel confessed. &ldquo;I only came back from Mexico last
      month, and I very soon got fed up with life in town. I am going abroad
      again next year. Till then, I am rather at a loose end. My father was
      always very keen indeed about this place, and very anxious that I should
      come and stay here for a little time, so I made up my mind to run down.
      I&rsquo;ve got some things waiting at Norwich. I thought I might hire a woman to
      look after me and spend a few weeks here. They tell me that the early
      spring is almost the best time for this coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded slowly. He moistened his lips for a moment. One might
      have imagined that he was anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;you are quite right. It is the best time to
      visit this coast. But why make a hermit of yourself? You are a family
      friend. Come and stay with us at the Hall for as long as you like. It will
      give me the utmost pleasure to welcome you there,&rdquo; he went on earnestly,
      &ldquo;and as for this little place, of what use is it to you? Let me buy it
      from you. You are a man of the world, I can see. You may be rich, yet
      money has a definite value. To me it has none. That little place, as it
      stands, is probably worth&mdash;say a hundred pounds. Your father gave, if
      I remember rightly, a five pound note for it. I will give you a thousand
      for it sooner than be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel frowned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not possibly think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of selling what was practically a
      gift to my father. You are welcome to occupy the place during my absence
      in any way you wish. On the other hand, I do not think that I care to part
      with it altogether, and I should really like to spend just a day or so
      here. I am used to roughing it under all sorts of conditions&mdash;much
      more used to roughing it than I am to staying at country houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin leaned a little out of his carriage. He reached the younger
      man&rsquo;s shoulder with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make up your mind too suddenly. Am I a
      little spoilt, I wonder? Well, you see what sort of a creature I am. I
      have to go through life as best I may, and people are kind to me. It is
      very seldom I am crossed. It is quite astonishing how often people let me
      have my own way. Do not make up your mind too suddenly. I have a niece and
      a nephew whom you must meet. There are some treasures, too, at St. David&rsquo;s
      Hall. Look at it. There isn&rsquo;t another house quite like it in England. It
      is worth looking over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most impressive,&rdquo; Hamel agreed, &ldquo;and wonderfully beautiful. It
      seems odd,&rdquo; he added, with a laugh, &ldquo;that you should care about this
      little shanty here, with all the beautiful rooms you must have of your
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin groaned. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Hamel, you are
      going to be gracious, aren&rsquo;t you? Let us leave the question of your little
      habitation here alone for the present. Come back with me. My niece shall
      give you some tea, and you shall choose your room from forty. You can
      sleep in a haunted chamber, or a historical chamber, in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      room, a Victorian chamber, or a Louis Quinze room. All my people have
      spent their substance in furniture. Don&rsquo;t look at your bag. Clothes are
      unnecessary. I can supply you with everything. Or, if you prefer it, I can
      send a fast car into Norwich for your own things. Come and be my guest,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel hesitated. He had not the slightest desire to go to St. David&rsquo;s
      Hall, and though he strove to ignore it, he was conscious of an aversion
      of which he was heartily ashamed for this strange fragment of humanity. On
      the other hand, his mission, the actual mission which had brought him down
      to these parts, could certainly best be served by an entree into the Hall
      itself&mdash;and there was the girl, whom he felt sure belonged there. He
      had never for a moment been able to dismiss her from his thoughts. Her
      still, cold face, the delicate perfection of her clothes and figure, the
      grey eyes which had rested upon his so curiously, haunted him. He was
      desperately anxious to see her again. If he refused this invitation, if he
      rejected Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s proffered friendship, it would be all the more
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really very kind,&rdquo; he began hesitatingly&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is settled,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin interrupted, &ldquo;settled. Meekins, you can ride
      back again. I shall not paint to-day. Mr. Hamel, you will walk by my side,
      will you not? I can run my little machine quite slowly. You see, I have an
      electric battery. It needs charging often, but I have a dynamo of my own.
      You never saw a vehicle like this in all your travellings, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An electrical bath-chair,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued. &ldquo;Practice has made me
      remarkably skilful in its manipulation. You see, I can steer to an inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was already turning around. Hamel rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really very kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should like to come up and see the
      Hall, at any rate, but in the meantime, as we are here, could I just look
      over the inside of this little place? I found the large shed where the
      lifeboat used to be kept, locked up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin was manoeuvring his carriage. His back was towards Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We will go in together. I have had the
      entrance widened so that I can ride straight into the sitting-room. But
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused suddenly. He felt in all his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I find that I have left the keys! We will come
      down a little later, if you do not mind, Mr. Hamel. Or to-morrow, perhaps.
      You will not mind? It is very careless of me, but seeing you about the
      place and imagining that you were an intruder, made me angry, and I
      started off in a hurry. Now walk by my side up to the house, please, and
      talk to me. It is so interesting for me to meet men,&rdquo; he went on, as they
      started along the straight path, &ldquo;who do things in life; who go to foreign
      countries, meet strange people, and have new experiences. I have been a
      good many years like this, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great affliction,&rdquo; Hamel murmured sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my youth I was an athlete,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued. &ldquo;I played cricket
      for the Varsity and for my county. I hunted, too, and shot. I did all the
      things a man loves to do. I might still shoot, they tell me, but my
      strength has ebbed away. I am too weak to lift a gun, too weak even to
      handle a fishing-rod. I have just a few hobbies in life which keep me
      alive. Are you a politician, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;I have been out of England too long to
      keep in touch with politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin agreed. &ldquo;It amuses me to follow the course of
      events. I have a good many friends in London and abroad who are kind to
      me, who keep me informed, send me odd bits of information not available
      for every one, and it amuses me to put these things together in my mind
      and to try and play the prophet. I was in the Foreign Office once, you
      know. I take up my paper every morning, and it is one of my chief
      interests to see how near my own speculations come to the truth. Just now
      for example, there are strange things doing on the Continent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In America,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;they affect to look upon England as a
      doomed Power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether supine yet,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin observed, &ldquo;yet even this last
      generation has seen weakening. We have lost so much self-reliance. Perhaps
      it is having these grown-up children who we think can take care of us&mdash;Canada
      and Australia, and the others. However, we will not talk of politics. It
      bores you, I can see. We will try and find some other subject. Now tell
      me, don&rsquo;t you think this is ingenious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the foot of the hill upon which the Hall was situated. In
      front of them, underneath the terrace, was a little iron gate, held open
      now by Meekins, who had gone on ahead and dismounted from his bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a subterranean way from here into the Hall,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      explained. &ldquo;Come with me. You will only have to stoop a little, and it may
      amuse you. You need not be afraid. There are electric lights every ten
      yards. I turn them on with this switch&mdash;see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin touched a button in the wall, and the place was at once
      brilliantly illuminated. A little row of lights from the ceiling and the
      walls stretched away as far as one could see. They passed through the iron
      gates, which shut behind them with a click. Stooping a little, Hamel was
      still able to walk by the side of the man in the chair. They traversed
      about a hundred yards of subterranean way. Here and there a fungus hung
      down from the wall, otherwise it was beautifully kept and dry. By and by,
      with a little turn, they came to an incline and another iron gate, held
      open for them by a footman. Mr. Fentolin sped up the last few feet into
      the great hall, which seemed more imposing than ever by reason of this
      unexpected entrance. Hamel, blinking a little, stepped to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin cried gaily. &ldquo;Welcome, my friend Mr. Hamel, to St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the next half-hour, Hamel was introduced to luxuries to which, in a
      general way, he was entirely unaccustomed. One man-servant was busy
      preparing his bath in a room leading out of his sleeping apartment, while
      another brought him a choice of evening clothes and superintended his
      disrobing. Hamel, always observant, studied his surroundings with keen
      interest. He found himself in a queerly mixed atmosphere of luxurious
      modernity and stately antiquity. His four-poster, the huge couch at the
      foot of his bed, and all the furniture about the room, was of the Queen
      Anne period. The bathroom which communicated with his apartment was the
      latest triumph of the plumber&rsquo;s art&mdash;a room with floor and walls of
      white tiles, the bath itself a little sunken and twice the ordinary size.
      He dispensed so far as he could with the services of the men and
      descended, as soon as he was dressed, into the hall. Meekins was waiting
      at the bottom of the stairs, dressed now in somber black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin will be glad if you will step into his room, sir,&rdquo; he
      announced, leading the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin was seated in his chair, reading the Times in a corner of his
      library. Shaped blocks had been placed behind and in front of the wheels
      of his little vehicle, to prevent it from moving. A shaded reading-lamp
      stood on the table by his side. He did not at once look up, and Hamel
      glanced around with genuine admiration. The shelves which lined the walls
      and the winged cases which protruded into the room were filled with books.
      There was a large oak table with beautifully carved legs, piled with all
      sorts of modern reviews and magazines. A log fire was burning in the big
      oaken grate. The perfume from a great bowl of lavender seemed to mingle
      curiously yet pleasantly with the half musty odour of the old
      leather-bound volumes. The massive chimneypiece was of black oak, and
      above it were carved the arms of the House of Fentolin. The walls were
      oak-panelled to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refreshed, I hope, by your bath and change, my dear visitor?&rdquo; the head of
      the house remarked, as he laid down his paper. &ldquo;Draw a chair up here and
      join me in a glass of vermouth. You need not be afraid of it. It comes to
      me from the maker as a special favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel accepted a quaintly-cut wine-glass full of the amber liquid. Mr.
      Fentolin sipped his with the air of a connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is one of our informal days. There is no one in the
      house save my sister-in-law, niece, and nephew, and a poor invalid
      gentleman who, I am sorry to say, is confined to his bed. My sister-in-law
      is also, I regret to say, indisposed. She desired me to present her
      excuses to you and say how greatly she is looking forward to making your
      acquaintance during the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On these occasions,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;we do not make use of a
      drawing-room. My niece will come in here presently. You are looking at my
      books, I see. Are you, by any chance, a bibliophile? I have a case of
      manuscripts here which might interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in the abstract, I fear,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have scarcely opened a
      serious book since I was at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was your year?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen years ago I left Magdalen,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;I had made up my
      mind to be an engineer, and I went over to the Boston Institute of
      Technology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A magnificent profession,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;A healthy one, too, I should
      judge from your appearance. You are a strong man, Mr. Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had reason to be,&rdquo; Hamel rejoined. &ldquo;During nearly the whole of the
      time I have been abroad, I have been practically pioneering. Building
      railways in the far West, with gangs of Chinese and Italians and
      Hungarians and scarcely a foreman who isn&rsquo;t terrified of his job, isn&rsquo;t
      exactly drawing-room work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going back there?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no plans,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have been fortunate enough, or shall I
      some day say unfortunate enough, I wonder, to have inherited a large
      legacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever doubt your good fortune,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;The longer I
      live&mdash;and in my limited way I do see a good deal of life&mdash;the
      more I appreciate the fact that there isn&rsquo;t anything in this world that
      compares with the power of money. I distrust a poor man. He may mean to be
      honest, but he is at all times subject to temptation. Ah! here is my
      niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin turned towards the door. Hamel rose at once to his feet. His
      surmise, then, had been correct. She was coming towards them very quietly.
      In her soft grey dinner-gown, her brown hair smoothly brushed back, a
      pearl necklace around her long, delicate neck, she seemed to him a very
      exquisite embodiment of those memories which he had been carrying about
      throughout the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; his host said, &ldquo;is a member of my family who has been a
      deserter for a short time. This is Mr. Richard Hamel, Esther; my niece,
      Miss Esther Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand with the faintest possible smile, which might have
      been of greeting or recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I travelled for some distance in the train with Mr. Hamel this afternoon,
      I think,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin exclaimed. &ldquo;Dear me, that is very interesting&mdash;very
      interesting, indeed! Mr. Hamel, I am sure, did not tell you of his
      destination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched them keenly. Hamel, though he scarcely understood, was quick to
      appreciate the possible significance of that tentative question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not exchange confidences,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Miss Fentolin only
      changed into my carriage during the last few minutes of her journey.
      Besides,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, my ideas as to my
      destination were a little hazy. To come and look for some queer sort of
      building by the side of the sea, which has been unoccupied for a dozen
      years or so, scarcely seems a reasonable quest, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely, indeed,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assented. &ldquo;You may thank me, Mr. Hamel,
      for the fact that the place is not in ruins. My blatant trespassing has
      saved you from that, at least. After dinner we must talk further about the
      Tower. To tell you the truth, I have grown accustomed to the use of the
      little place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the dinner gong boomed through the house. A moment later
      Gerald entered, followed by a butler announcing dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only remaining member of my family,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked,
      indicating his nephew. &ldquo;Gerald, you will be pleased, I know, to meet Mr.
      Hamel. Mr. Hamel has been a great traveller. Long before you can remember,
      his father used to paint wonderful pictures of this coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shook hands with his visitor. His face, for a moment, lighted up.
      He was looking pale, though, and singularly sullen and dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two of your father&rsquo;s pictures in the modern side of the gallery
      up-stairs,&rdquo; he remarked, a little diffidently. &ldquo;They are great favourites
      with everybody here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all went in to dinner together. Meekins, who had appeared silently,
      had glided unnoticed behind his master&rsquo;s chair and wheeled it across the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A partie carree to-night,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;I have a resident
      doctor here, a very delightful person, who often dines with us, but
      to-night I thought not. Five is an awkward number. I want to get to know
      you better, Mr. Hamel, and quickly. I want you, too, to make friends with
      my niece and nephew. Mr. Hamel&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; he went on, addressing the two
      latter, &ldquo;and your father were great friends. By-the-by, have I told you
      both exactly why Mr. Hamel is a guest here to-night&mdash;why he came to
      these parts at all? No? Listen, then. He came to take possession of the
      Tower. The worst of it is that it belongs to him, too. His father bought
      it from your father more years ago than we should care to talk about. I
      have really been a trespasser all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took their places at a small round table in the middle of the
      dining-room. The shaded lights thrown downwards upon the table seemed to
      leave most of the rest of the apartment in semi-darkness. The gloomy faces
      of the men and women whose pictures hung upon the walls were almost
      invisible. The servants themselves, standing a little outside the halo of
      light, were like shadows passing swiftly and noiselessly back and forth.
      At the far end of the room was an organ, and to the left a little balcony,
      built out as though for an orchestra. Hamel looked about him almost in
      wonderment. There was something curiously impressive in the size of the
      apartment and its emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trespasser,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, as he took up the menu and
      criticised it through his horn-rimmed eyeglass, &ldquo;that is what I have been,
      without a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for your interest and consequent trespass,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;I should
      probably have found the roof off and the whole place in ruins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of which you found the door locked against you,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      pointed out. &ldquo;Well, we shall see. I might, at any rate, have lost the
      opportunity of entertaining you here this evening. I am particularly glad
      to have an opportunity of making you known to my niece and nephew. I think
      you will agree with me that here are two young people who are highly to be
      commended. I cannot offer them a cheerful life here. There is little
      society, no gaiety, no sort of excitement. Yet they never leave me. They
      seem to have no other interest in life but to be always at my beck and
      call. A case, Mr. Hamel, of really touching devotion. If anything could
      reconcile me to my miserable condition, it would be the kindness and
      consideration of those by whom I am surrounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel murmured a few words of cordial agreement. Yet he found himself, in
      a sense, embarrassed. Gerald was looking down upon his plate and his face
      was hidden. Esther&rsquo;s features had suddenly become stony and
      expressionless. Hamel felt instinctively that something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are compensations,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, with the air of one
      enjoying speech, &ldquo;which find their way into even the gloomiest of lives.
      As I lie on my back, hour after hour, I feel all the more conscious of
      this. The world is a school of compensations, Mr. Hamel. The interests&mdash;the
      mental interests, I mean&mdash;of unfortunate people like myself, come to
      possess in time a peculiar significance and to yield a peculiar pleasure.
      I have hobbies, Mr. Hamel. I frankly admit it. Without my hobbies, I
      shudder to think what might become of me. I might become a selfish, cruel,
      misanthropical person. Hobbies are indeed a great thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother and sister sat still in stony silence. Hamel, looking across
      the little table with its glittering load of cut glass and silver and
      scarlet flowers, caught something in Esther&rsquo;s eyes, so rarely expressive
      of any emotion whatever, which puzzled him. He looked swiftly back at his
      host. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face, at that moment, was like a beautiful cameo. His
      expression was one of gentle benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be quite frank with you,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin murmured. &ldquo;My occupation of
      the Tower is one of these hobbies. I love to sit there within a few yards
      of the sea and watch the tide come in. I catch something of the spirit, I
      think, which caught your father, Mr. Hamel, and kept him a prisoner here.
      In my small way I, too, paint while I am down there, paint and dream.
      These things may not appeal to you, but you must remember that there are
      few things left to me in life, and that those, therefore, which I can make
      use of, are dear to me. Gerald, you are silent to-night. How is it that
      you say nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am tired, sir,&rdquo; the boy answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is inexcusable of me,&rdquo; he declared smoothly, &ldquo;to have forgotten even
      for a moment. My nephew, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;had quite an exciting
      experience last night&mdash;or rather a series of experiences. He was
      first of all in a railway accident, and then, for the sake of a poor
      fellow who was with him and who was badly hurt, he motored back here in
      the grey hours of the morning and ran, they tell me, considerable risk of
      being drowned on the marshes. A very wonderful and praiseworthy adventure,
      I consider it. I trust that our friend up-stairs, when he recovers, will
      be properly grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald rose to his feet precipitately. The service of dinner was almost
      concluded, and he muttered something which sounded like an excuse. Mr.
      Fentolin, however, stretched out his hand and motioned him to resume his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Gerald!&rdquo; he exclaimed reprovingly. &ldquo;You would leave us so
      abruptly? Before your sister, too! What will Mr. Hamel think of our
      country ways? Pray resume your seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the boy stood quite still, then he slowly subsided into his
      chair. Mr. Fentolin passed around a decanter of wine which had been placed
      upon the table by the butler. The servants had now left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse my nephew, if you please, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Gerald
      has a boy&rsquo;s curious aversion to praise in any form. I am looking forward
      to hearing your verdict upon my port. The collection of wine and pictures
      was a hobby of my grandfather&rsquo;s, for which we, his descendants, can never
      be sufficiently grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel praised his wine, as indeed he had every reason to, but for a few
      moments the smooth conversation of his host fell upon deaf ears. He looked
      from the boy&rsquo;s face, pale and wrinkled as though with some sort of
      suppressed pain, to the girl&rsquo;s still, stony expression. This was indeed a
      house of mysteries! There was something here incomprehensible, some thing
      about the relations of these three and their knowledge of one another,
      utterly baffling. It was the queerest household, surely, into which any
      stranger had ever been precipitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The planting of trees and the laying down of port are two virtues in our
      ancestors which have never been properly appreciated,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      continued. &ldquo;Let us, at any rate, free ourselves from the reproach of
      ingratitude so far as regards my grandfather&mdash;Gerald Fentolin&mdash;to
      whom I believe we are indebted for this wine. We will drink&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin broke off in the middle of his sentence. The august calm of
      the great house had been suddenly broken. From up-stairs came the tumult
      of raised voices, the slamming of a door, the falling of something heavy
      upon the floor. Mr. Fentolin listened with a grim change in his
      expression. His smile had departed, his lower lip was thrust out, his
      eyebrows met. He raised the little whistle which hung from his chain. At
      that moment, however, the door was opened. Doctor Sarson appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to disturb you, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but our patient is
      becoming a little difficult. The concussion has left him, as I feared it
      might, in a state of nervous excitability. He insists upon an interview
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin backed his little chair from the table. The doctor came over
      and laid his hand upon the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, I am sure, excuse me for a few moments, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; his host
      begged. &ldquo;My niece and nephew will do their best to entertain you. Now,
      Sarson, I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glided across the dim, empty spaces of the splendid
      apartment, followed by the doctor; a ghostly little procession it seemed.
      The door was closed behind them. For a few moments a curious silence
      ensued. Gerald remained tense and apparently suffering from some sort of
      suppressed emotion. Esther for the first time moved in her place. She
      leaned towards Hamel. Her lips were slowly parted, her eyes sought the
      door as though in terror. Her voice, although save for themselves there
      was no one else in the whole of that great apartment, had sunk to the
      lowest of whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a brave man, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was staggered but he answered her promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up the Tower&mdash;just yet. That is what&mdash;he has brought
      you here for. He wants you to give it up and go back. Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The earnestness of her words was unmistakable. Hamel felt the thrill of
      coming events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Only if you are brave, if you have feeling
      for others, keep the Tower, if it be for only a week. Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door had been noiselessly opened. The doctor appeared and advanced to
      the table with a grave little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has been kind enough to suggest that I take a
      glass of wine with you. My presence is not needed up-stairs. Mr. Hamel,&rdquo;
       he added, &ldquo;I am glad, sir, to make your acquaintance. I have for a long
      time been a great admirer of your father&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his place at the head of the table and, filling his glass, bowed
      towards Hamel. Once more Gerald and his sister relapsed almost
      automatically into an indifferent and cultivated silence. Hamel found
      civility towards the newcomer difficult. Unconsciously his attitude became
      that of the other two. He resented the intrusion. He found himself
      regarding the advent of Doctor Sarson as possessing some secondary
      significance. It was almost as though Mr. Fentolin preferred not to leave
      him alone with his niece and nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, his voice, when he spoke, was clear and firm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, on leaving the dining-room, steered his chair with great
      precision through the open, wrought-iron doors of a small lift at the
      further end of the hall, which Doctor Sarson, who stepped in with him,
      promptly directed to the second floor. Here they made their way to the
      room in which Mr. Dunster was lying. Doctor Sarson opened the door and
      looked in. Almost immediately he stood at one side, out of sight of Mr.
      Dunster, and nodded to Mr. Fentolin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any trouble,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;send for me. I am better away,
      for the present. My presence only excites him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go down into the dining-room. I am not sure
      about that fellow Hamel, and Gerald is in a queer temper. Stay with them.
      See that they are not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor silently withdrew, and Mr. Fentolin promptly glided past him
      into the room. Mr. John P. Dunster, in his night clothes, was sitting on
      the side of the bed. Standing within a few feet of him, watching him all
      the time with the subtle intentness of a cat watching a mouse, stood
      Meekins. Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s head was still bound, although the bandage had
      slipped a little, apparently in some struggle. His face was chalklike, and
      he was breathing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come at last!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a little truculently. &ldquo;Are you Mr.
      Fentolin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin gravely admitted his identity. His eyes rested upon his guest
      with an air of tender interest. His face was almost beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the owner of this house&mdash;I am underneath your roof&mdash;is
      that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly St. David&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied. &ldquo;It really
      appears as though your conclusions were correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you tell me why I am kept a prisoner here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s expression was for a moment clouded. He seemed hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prisoner,&rdquo; he repeated softly. &ldquo;My dear Mr. Dunster, you have surely
      forgotten the circumstances which procured for me the pleasure of this
      visit; the condition in which you arrived here&mdash;only, after all, a
      very few hours ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circumstances,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster declared drily, &ldquo;are to me still
      inexplicable. At Liverpool Street Station I was accosted by a young man
      who informed me that his name was Gerald Fentolin, and that he was on his
      way to The Hague to play in a golf tournament. His story seemed entirely
      probable, and I permitted him a seat in the special train I had chartered
      for Harwich. There was an accident and I received this blow to my head&mdash;only
      a trifling affair, after all. I come to my senses to find myself here. I
      do not know exactly what part of the world you call this, but from the
      fact that I can see the sea from my window, it must be some considerable
      distance from the scene of the accident. I find that my dressing-case has
      been opened, my pocket-book examined, and I am apparently a prisoner. I
      ask you, Mr. Fentolin, for an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my dear Mr. Dunster, I believe I may have the
      pleasure of calling you&mdash;your conclusions seem to me just a little
      melodramatic. My nephew&mdash;Gerald Fentolin&mdash;did what I consider
      the natural thing, under the circumstances. You had been courteous to him,
      and he repaid the obligation to the best of his ability. The accident to
      your train happened in a dreary part of the country, some thirty miles
      from here. My nephew adopted a course which I think, under the
      circumstances, was the natural and hospitable one. He brought you to his
      home. There was no hospital or town of any importance nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster decided. &ldquo;I will accept your version of the
      affair. I will, then, up to this point acknowledge myself your debtor. But
      will you tell me why my dressing-case has been opened, my clothes removed,
      and a pocket-book containing papers of great importance to me has been
      tampered with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; his host repelled calmly, &ldquo;you surely cannot
      imagine that you are among thieves! Your dressing-case was opened and the
      contents of your pocket-book inspected with a view to ascertaining your
      address, or the names of some friends with whom we might communicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that they are to be restored to me, then?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt, yes!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assured him. &ldquo;You, however, are not
      fit for anything, at the present moment, but to return to your bed, from
      which I understand you rose rather suddenly a few minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster insisted, &ldquo;I am feeling absolutely well
      enough to travel. I have an appointment on the Continent of great
      importance, as you may judge by the fact that at Liverpool Street I
      chartered a special train. I trust that nothing in my manner may have
      given you offence, but I am anxious to get through with the business which
      brought me over to this side of the water. I have sent for you to ask that
      my pocket-book, dressing-case, and clothes be at once restored to me, and
      that I be provided with the means of continuing my journey without a
      moment&rsquo;s further delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head very gently, very regretfully, but also
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;do be reasonable. Think of all you have been
      through. I can quite sympathise with you in your impatience, but I am
      forced to tell you that the doctor who has been attending you since the
      moment you were brought into this house has absolutely forbidden anything
      of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster seemed, for a moment, to struggle for composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an American citizen,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I am willing to listen to the
      advice of any physician, but so long as I take the risk, I am not bound to
      follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the present case I decline to follow it. I ask for facilities to leave
      this house at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your own interests,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;they will not be granted to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster had spoken all the time like a man struggling to preserve his
      self-control. There were signs now that his will was ceasing to serve him.
      His eyes flashed fire, his voice was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not be granted to me?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you mean to say, then, that
      I am to be kept here against my will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin made no immediate reply. With the delicate fingers of his
      right hand he pushed back the hair from his forehead. He looked at his
      questioner soothingly, as one might look at a spoiled child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against my will?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster repeated, raising his voice still higher.
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin, if the truth must be told, I have heard of you before and
      been warned against you. I decline to accept any longer the hospitality of
      your roof. I insist upon leaving it. If you will not provide me with any
      means of doing so, I will walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a motion as though to rise from the bed. Meekins&rsquo; hand very gently
      closed upon his arm. One could judge that the grip was like a grip of
      iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said, &ldquo;this is really very unreasonable of you! If
      you have heard of me, Mr. Dunster, you ought to understand that
      notwithstanding my unfortunate physical trouble, I am a person of
      consequence and position in this county. I am a magistrate, ex-high
      sheriff, and a great land-owner here. I think I may say without boasting
      that I represent one of the most ancient families in this country. Why,
      therefore, should you treat me as though it were to my interest to
      inveigle you under my roof and keep you there for some guilty purpose?
      Cannot you understand that it is for your own good I hesitate to part with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;Let us
      bring this nonsense to an end. I want my clothes, and if you won&rsquo;t lend me
      a car or a trap, I&rsquo;ll walk to the nearest railway station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are not in a position to travel.
      Even in the dining-room just now I heard a disturbance for which I was
      told that you were responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply insisted upon having my clothes,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster explained. &ldquo;Your
      servant refused to fetch them. Perhaps I lost my temper. If so, I am
      sorry. I am not used to being thwarted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days&rsquo; rest&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days&rsquo; rest be hanged!&rdquo; Mr. Dunster interrupted fiercely. &ldquo;Listen,
      Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he added, with the air of one making a last effort to
      preserve his temper, &ldquo;the mission with which I am charged is one of
      greater importance than you can imagine. So much depends upon it that my
      own life, if that is in danger, would be a mere trifle in comparison with
      the issues involved. If I am not allowed to continue upon my journey at
      once, the consequences may be more serious than I can tell you, to you and
      yours, to your own country. There!&mdash;I am telling you a great deal,
      but I want you to understand that I am in earnest. I have a mission which
      I must perform, and which I must perform quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very mysterious,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave nothing to chance,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued. &ldquo;Send this man
      who seems to have constituted himself my jailer out of earshot, and I will
      tell you even more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin turned to Meekins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can leave the room for a moment,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Wait upon the
      threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins very unwillingly turned to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he objected doubtfully, &ldquo;but I am not at all
      sure that he is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need have no fear, Meekins,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I am quite sure that you
      are mistaken. I think that Mr. Dunster is incapable of any act of violence
      towards a person in my unfortunate position. I am willing to trust myself
      with him&mdash;perfectly willing, Meekins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins, with ponderous footsteps, left the room and closed the door
      behind him. Mr. Fentolin leaned a little forward in his chair. It seemed
      as though he were on springs. The fingers of his right hand had
      disappeared in the pocket of his black velvet dinner-coat. He was
      certainly prepared for all emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;you can speak to me without reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster dropped his voice. His tone became one of fierce eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to force me to give
      myself away like this, but, after all, you are an Englishman, with a stake
      in your country, and I presume you don&rsquo;t want her to take a back seat for
      the next few generations. Listen here. It&rsquo;s to save your country that I
      want to get to The Hague without a second&rsquo;s delay. I tell you that if I
      don&rsquo;t get there, if the message I convey doesn&rsquo;t reach its destination,
      you may find an agreement signed between certain Powers which will mean
      the greatest diplomatic humiliation which Great Britain has ever known.
      Aye, and more than that!&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued. &ldquo;It may be that the bogey
      you&rsquo;ve been setting before yourself for all these years may trot out into
      life, and you may find St. David&rsquo;s Hall a barrack for German soldiers
      before many months have passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head in gentle disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking to one,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;who knows more of the political
      situation than you imagine. In my younger days I was in the Foreign
      Office. Since my unfortunate accident I have preserved the keenest
      interest in politics. I tell you frankly that I do not believe you. As the
      Powers are grouped at present, I do not believe in the possibility of a
      successful invasion of this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster replied eagerly, &ldquo;but the grouping of the
      Powers as it has existed during the last few years is on the eve of a
      great change. I cannot take you wholly into my confidence. I can only give
      you my word of honour as a friend to your country that the message I carry
      is her only salvation. Having told you as much as that, I do not think I
      am asking too much if I ask you for my clothes and dressing-case, and for
      the fastest motor-car you can furnish me with. I guess I can get from here
      to Yarmouth, and from there I can charter something which will take me to
      the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin raised the little gold whistle to his lips and blew it very
      softly. Meekins at once entered, closing the door behind him. He moved
      silently to the side of the man who had risen now from the bed, and who
      was standing with his hand grasping the post and his eyes fixed upon Mr.
      Fentolin, as though awaiting his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our conversation,&rdquo; the latter said calmly, &ldquo;has reached a point, Mr.
      Dunster, at which I think we may leave it for the moment. You have told me
      some very surprising things. I perceive that you are a more interesting
      visitor even than I had thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his left hand, and Meekins, who seemed to have been waiting for
      some signal of the sort, suddenly, with a movement of his knee and right
      arm, flung Dunster back upon the bed. The man opened his mouth to shout,
      but already, with lightning-like dexterity, his assailant had inserted a
      gag between his teeth. Treating his struggles as the struggles of a baby,
      Meekins next proceeded to secure his wrists with handcuffs. He then held
      his feet together while he quietly wound a coil of cord around them. Mr.
      Fentolin watched the proceedings from his chair with an air of pleased and
      critical interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well done, Meekins&mdash;very neatly done, indeed!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;As I was saying, Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he continued, turning his chair, &ldquo;our
      conversation has reached a point at which I think we may safely leave it
      for a time. We will discuss these matters again. Your pretext of a
      political mission is, of course, an absurd one, but fortunately you have
      fallen into good hands. Take good care of Mr. Dunster, Meekins. I can see
      that he is a very important personage. We must be careful not to lose
      sight of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin steered his chair to the door, opened it, and passed out. On
      the landing he blew his whistle; the lift almost immediately ascended. A
      moment or two later he glided into the dining-room. The three men were
      still seated around the table. A decanter of wine, almost empty, was
      before Doctor Sarson, whose pallid cheeks, however, were as yet unflushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, my dear guest,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin exclaimed, turning to Hamel, &ldquo;I am
      able to return to you. If you will drink no more wine, let us have our
      coffee in the library, you and I. I want to talk to you about the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin led the way to a delightful little corner of his library,
      where before the open grate, recently piled with hissing logs, an easy
      chair had been drawn. He wheeled himself up to the other side of the
      hearthrug and leaned back with a little air of exhaustion. The butler, who
      seemed to have appeared unsummoned from somewhere among the shadows,
      served coffee and poured some old brandy into large and wonderfully thin
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why my house should be turned into an asylum to gratify the hospitable
      instincts of my young nephew, I cannot imagine,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin grumbled. &ldquo;A
      most extraordinary person, our visitor, I can assure you. Quite violent,
      too, he was at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had any outside advice about his condition?&rdquo; Hamel inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glanced across those few feet of space and looked at Hamel
      with swift suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Doctor Sarson is fully qualified, and the case
      seems to present no unusual characteristics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel sipped his brandy thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I suggested it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I only thought that an
      outside doctor might help you to get rid of the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the matter is of no real consequence. Doctor Sarson
      assures me that we shall be able to send him on his way very shortly. In
      the meantime, Mr. Hamel, what about the Tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; Hamel asked, selecting a cigar from the box which had
      been pushed to his side. &ldquo;I am sure I haven&rsquo;t any wish to inconvenience
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be quite frank,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;I do not dispute your
      right for a moment. On the other hand, my few hours daily down there have
      become a habit with me. I do not wish to give them up. Stay here with us,
      Mr. Hamel. You will be doing us a great kindness. My nephew and niece have
      too little congenial society. Make up your mind to give us a fortnight of
      your time, and I can assure you that we will do our best to make yours a
      pleasant stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel was a little taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of accepting your hospitality
      to such an extent. My idea in coming here was simply to fulfil an old
      promise to my father and to rough it at the Tower for a week or so, and
      when that was over, I don&rsquo;t suppose I should ever be likely to come back
      again. You had better let me carry out that plan, and afterwards the place
      shall be entirely at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin persisted, a little irritably.
      &ldquo;I sit there every morning. I want, for instance, to be there to-morrow
      morning, and the next morning, and the morning afterwards, to finish a
      little seascape I have commenced. Nowhere else will do. Call it a whim or
      what you will I have begun the picture, and I want to finish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can sit there all right,&rdquo; Hamel assured him. &ldquo;I shall be out
      playing golf or fishing. I shall do nothing but sleep there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very uncomfortable you will be,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin pointed out. &ldquo;You have
      no servant, I understand, and there is no one in the village fit to look
      after you. Think of my thirty-nine empty rooms, my books here, my gardens,
      my motor-cars, my young people, entirely at your service. You can have a
      suite to yourself. You can disappear when you like. To all effects and
      purposes you will be the master of St. David&rsquo;s Hall. Be reasonable. Don&rsquo;t
      you think, now, that you can spend a fortnight more pleasantly under such
      circumstances than by playing the misanthrope down at the Tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; Hamel begged, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t appreciate your
      hospitality. I should feel uncomfortable, however, if I paid you a visit
      of the length you have suggested. Come, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;why my
      occupation of the Tower should interfere with you. I should be away from
      it by about nine or ten o&rsquo;clock every morning. I should probably only
      sleep there. Can&rsquo;t you accept the use of it all the rest of the time? I
      can assure you that you will be welcome to come and go as though it were
      entirely your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin had lit a cigarette and was watching the blue smoke curl
      upwards to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an obstinate man, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;but I suppose you must
      have your own way. By-the-by, you would only need to use the up-stairs
      room and the sitting-room. You will not need the outhouse&mdash;rather
      more than an outhouse, though isn&rsquo;t it? I mean the shed which leads out
      from the kitchen, where the lifeboat used to be kept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall need that,&rdquo; Hamel admitted, a little hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;among my other hobbies I
      have done a little inventing. I work sometimes at a model there. It is
      foolish, perhaps, but I wish no one to see it. Do you mind if I keep the
      keys of the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;Tell me, what direction do your
      inventions take, Mr. Fentolin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin promised, &ldquo;I will show you my little model
      at work. Until then we will not talk of it. Now come, be frank with me.
      Shall we exchange ideas for a little time? Will you talk of books? They
      are my daily friends. I have thousands of them, beloved companions on
      every side. Or will you talk of politics or travel? Or would you rather be
      frivolous with my niece and nephew? That, I think, is Esther playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be quite frank,&rdquo; Hamel declared bluntly, &ldquo;I should like to talk to
      your niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled as though amused. His amusement, however, was
      perfectly good-natured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will open this door,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will see another one exactly
      opposite to you. That is the drawing-room. You will find Esther there.
      Before you go, will you pass me the Quarterly Review? Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel crossed the hall, opened the door of the room to which he had been
      directed, and made his way towards the piano. Esther was there, playing
      softly to herself with eyes half closed. He came and stood by her side,
      and she stopped abruptly. Her eyes questioned him. Then her fingers stole
      once more over the keys, more softly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just left your uncle,&rdquo; Hamel said. &ldquo;He told me that I might come
      in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very hospitable,&rdquo; Hamel continued. &ldquo;He wanted me to remain here as
      a guest and not go to the Tower at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the Tower,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going there to-morrow or the day
      after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music swelled beneath her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a week or so. I am just giving your uncle time to clear out his
      belongings. I am leaving him the outhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked you to leave him that?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going in there at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she played a little more loudly for a few moments. Then the music
      died away once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reason did he give for keeping possession of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another hobby,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;He is an inventor, it seems. He has the
      model of something there; he would not tell me what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little, and her music drifted away. She bent over the keys,
      her face hidden from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go away just yet?&rdquo; she asked softly. &ldquo;You are going to stay
      for a few days, at any rate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I am altogether my own master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned with his elbow against the top of the piano, looking down at
      her. Since dinnertime she had fastened a large red rose in the front of
      her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that this is all rather mysterious?&rdquo; he said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is mysterious?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The atmosphere of the place: your uncle&rsquo;s queer aversion to my having the
      Tower; your visitor up-stairs, who fights with the servants while we are
      at dinner; your uncle himself, whose will seems to be law not only to you
      but to your brother, who must be of age, I should think, and who seems to
      have plenty of spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live here, both of us,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;He is our guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Hamel replied, &ldquo;and yet, it may have been my fancy, of
      course, but at dinnertime I seemed to get a queer impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it me?&rdquo; she insisted, her fingers breaking suddenly into a livelier
      melody. &ldquo;Tell it me at once? You were there all the time. I could see you
      watching. Tell me what you thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned her head now, and her eyes were fixed upon his. They were
      large and soft, capable, he knew, of infinite expression. Yet at that
      moment the light that shone from them was simply one of fear, half
      curious, half shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My impression,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was that both of you disliked and feared Mr.
      Fentolin, yet for some reason or other that you were his abject slaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers seemed suddenly inspired with diabolical strength and energy.
      Strange chords crashed and broke beneath them. She played some unfamiliar
      music with tense and fierce energy. Suddenly she paused and rose to her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out on to the terrace,&rdquo; she invited. &ldquo;You are not afraid of cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her without a word. She opened the French windows, and they
      stepped out on to the long, broad stone promenade. The night was dark, and
      there was little to be seen. The light was burning at the entrance to the
      waterway; a few lights were twinkling from the village. The soft moaning
      of the sea was distinctly audible. She moved to the edge of the
      palisading. He followed her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think that I am more afraid of
      him than any woman ever was of any man in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you live here?&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You must have other relations
      to whom you could go. And your brother&mdash;why doesn&rsquo;t he do something&mdash;go
      into one of the professions? He could surely leave easily enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you a secret,&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;Perhaps it will help you
      to understand. You know my uncle&rsquo;s condition. You know that it was the
      result of an accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so,&rdquo; he replied gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clutched at his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side they walked the entire length of the terrace. When they
      reached the corner, they were met with a fierce gust of wind. She battled
      along, and he followed her. They were looking inland now. There were no
      lights visible&mdash;nothing but dark, chaotic emptiness. From somewhere
      below him he could hear the wind in the tree-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked to the very edge of the palisading. It was scarcely more than
      a couple of feet high. She pointed downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees his eyes faintly penetrated the darkness. It was as though they
      were looking down a precipice. The descent was perfectly sheer for nearly
      a hundred feet. At the bottom were the pine trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here again in the morning,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You will see then. I
      brought you here to show you the place. It was here that the accident
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It was here that he went over. He was
      picked up with both his legs broken. They never thought that he would
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shivered a little. As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he
      saw more distinctly than ever the sheer fall, the tops of the bending
      trees below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a horrible thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was more horrible than you know,&rdquo; she continued, dropping her voice a
      little, almost whispering in his ear. &ldquo;I do not know why I tell you this&mdash;you,
      a stranger&mdash;but if I do not tell some one, I think that the memory of
      it will drive me mad. It was no accident at all. Mr. Fentolin was thrown
      over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to his arm for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;No one knows. My uncle gave out, as soon
      as he was conscious, that it was an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, at any rate, was fine of him,&rdquo; Hamel declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was proud, at least, of our family name. Whatever credit he deserves
      for it, he must have. It was owing to that accident that we became his
      slaves: nothing but that&mdash;his absolute slaves, to wait upon him, if
      he would, hand and foot. You see, he has never been able to marry. His
      life was, of course, ruined. So the burden came to us. We took it up,
      little thinking what was in store for us. Five years ago we came here to
      live. Gerald wanted to go into the army; I wanted to travel with my
      mother. Gerald has done all the work secretly, but he has never been
      allowed to pass his examinations. I have never left England except to
      spend two years at the strictest boarding-school in Paris, to which I was
      taken and fetched away by one of his creatures. We live here, with the
      shadow of this thing always with us. We are his puppets. If we hesitate to
      do his bidding, he reminds us. So far, we have been his creatures, body
      and soul. Whether it will go on, I cannot say&mdash;oh, I cannot say! It
      is bad for us, but&mdash;there is mother, too. He makes her life a perfect
      hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A roar of wind came booming once more across the marshes, bending the
      trees which grew so thickly beneath them and which ascended precipitately
      to the back of the house. The French windows behind rattled. She looked
      around nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of him all the time,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;He seems to overhear
      everything&mdash;he or his creatures. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for several moments. He whispered in her ear so closely
      that through the darkness he could, see the fire in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are telling me half,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me everything. Who threw your
      uncle over the parapet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood by his side, motionless and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the passion of a moment,&rdquo; she said at last, speaking hoarsely. &ldquo;I
      cannot tell you. Listen! Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one near,&rdquo; Hamel assured her. &ldquo;It is the wind which shakes
      the windows. I wish that you would tell me everything. I would like to be
      your friend. Believe me, I have that desire, really. There are so many
      things which I do not understand. That it is dull here for you, of course,
      is natural, but there is something more than that. You seem always to fear
      something. Your uncle is a selfish man, naturally, although to look at him
      he seems to have the disposition of an angel. But beyond that, is there
      anything of which you are afraid? You seem all the time to live in fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly clutched his hand. There was nothing of affection in her
      touch, and yet he felt a thrill of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are strange things which happen here,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;things which
      neither Gerald nor I understand. Yet they terrify us. I think that very
      soon the end will come. Neither of us can stand it very much longer. We
      have no friends. Somehow or other, he seems to manage to keep us always
      isolated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go away from here,&rdquo; Hamel said firmly, &ldquo;at present. Mind, I
      am not at all sure that, living this solitary life as you do, you have not
      become a little over-nervous; that you have not exaggerated the fear of
      some things. To me your uncle seems merely quixotic and egregiously
      selfish. However that may be, I am going to remain.&rdquo; She clutched once
      more at his arm, her finger was upraised. They listened together. From
      somewhere behind them came the clear, low wailing of a violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Please come in; let us go in at
      once. He only plays when he is excited. I am afraid! Oh, I am afraid that
      something is going to happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was already round the corner and on her way to the main terrace. He
      followed her closely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us follow the example of all great golfers,&rdquo; Hamel said. &ldquo;Let us for
      this morning, at any rate, imagine that your whole world is encompassed
      within these eighteen holes. We have been sent here in a moment of good
      humour by your tyrant uncle. The sun shines, and the wind is from the
      west. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well for you,&rdquo; she retorted, smiling, &ldquo;but I have topped
      my drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purely an incident,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;The vicissitudes of the game do not
      enter into the question. I have driven a ball far above my usual form, but
      I am not gloating over it. I prefer to remember only that I am going to
      spend the next two hours with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She played her shot, and they walked for a little way together. She was
      suddenly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said finally, just a little gravely, &ldquo;I am not at all
      used to speeches of this sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Nothing but the lonely life you have
      been living has kept you from hearing them continually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little at the impotence of her rebuff and paused for a
      moment to make her next shot. Hamel, standing a little on one side,
      watched her appraisingly. Her short, grey tweed skirt was obviously the
      handiwork of an accomplished tailor. Her grey stockings and suede shoes
      were immaculate and showed a care for her appearance which pleased him.
      Her swing, too, revealed a grace, the grace of long arms and a supple
      body, at which previously he had only guessed. The sunshine seemed to have
      brought out a copper tinge from her abundant brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I think I am beginning to like your uncle.
      Great idea of his, sending us off here directly after breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face darkened for a moment, and he realised his error. The same
      thought, indeed, had been in both their minds. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s courteous
      suggestion had been offered to them almost in the shape of a command. It
      was scarcely possible to escape from the reflection that he had desired to
      rid himself of their presence for the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I knew that these links were good&mdash;quite
      famous, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have played on so few others,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I learned my golf here
      with King, the professional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took off his cap and handed it to his caddy. He himself was beginning
      already to look younger. The long blue waves came rippling up the creeks.
      The salt wind, soft with sunshine, blew in their faces. The marshes on the
      landward side were mauve with lavender blossom. In the distance, the
      red-tiled cottages nestled deep among a background of green trees and
      rising fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This indeed is a land of peace,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t to give you
      quite so many strokes, I should be really enjoying myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t play like a man who has been living abroad for a great many
      years,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Tell me about some of the places you have visited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk seriously,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of them but let
      it be later on. This morning I feel that the spring air is getting into my
      head. I have an absurd desire to talk nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t been altogether unsuccessful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are alluding,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to the personal remarks I was
      emboldened to make on my way here, I can only say that they were excused
      by their truthfulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sure that you have known me long enough to tell me what
      colours suit me,&rdquo; she demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what will you say,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;if I admire the angle of that
      quill in your hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;If you continue like this, I may have to go
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sent the car away,&rdquo; he reminded her cheerfully. &ldquo;You would
      simply have to sit upon the balcony and reflect upon your wasted morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to talk upon the putting green,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It puts me off. If
      you will stand perfectly quiet and say nothing, I will play the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved off presently to the next teeing ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this nonsense is good for our golf,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is immensely good for us as human beings,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had played the ninth hole and turned for home. On their right now was
      a shimmering stretch of wet sand and a thin line of sea, in the distance.
      The tide, receding, had left little islands of virgin sand, grass tufted,
      the home of countless sea-gulls. A brown-sailed fishing boat was racing
      for the narrow entrance to the tidal way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am beginning to understand what there is about this coast which
      fascinated my father so,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;Years ago I used to love it, but not
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to change the subject, but the gloom had settled upon her face
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is like,&rdquo; she went on, as they walked side by side
      after their balls, &ldquo;to live day and night in fear, with no one to talk to&mdash;no
      one, that is to say, who is not under the same shadow. Even the voices of
      the wind and the sea, and the screaming of the birds, seem to bring always
      an evil message. There is nothing kindly or hopeful even in the sunshine.
      At night, when the tide comes thundering in as it does so often at this
      time of the year, one is afraid. There is so much to make one afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned pale again, notwithstanding the sunshine and the freshening
      wind. He laid his hand lightly upon her arm. She suffered his touch
      without appearing to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you mustn&rsquo;t talk like that!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Do you know what you make
      me feel like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came back from the world of her own unhappy imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I forgot myself,&rdquo; she declared, with a little smile. &ldquo;Never mind,
      it does one good sometimes. One up, are you? Henceforth, then, golf&mdash;all
      the rigour of the game, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell in with her mood, and their conversation touched only upon the
      game. On the last green he suffered defeat and acknowledged it with a
      little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might say so, Miss Fentolin,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;you are a little too
      good for your handicap. I used to play a very reasonable scratch myself,
      but I can&rsquo;t give you the strokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless your long absence abroad,&rdquo; she began slowly, &ldquo;has affected your
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was round in eighty-one,&rdquo; he grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have travelled in many countries,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;where golf
      was an impossibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Let us stay and have lunch and try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head with a little sigh of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the car is waiting,&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;We are expected home. I
      shan&rsquo;t be a minute putting my clubs away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sped swiftly along the level road towards St. David&rsquo;s Hall. Far in
      the distance they saw it, built upon that strange hill, with the sunlight
      flashing in its windows. He looked at it long and curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that yours is the most extraordinarily situated house
      I have ever seen. Fancy a gigantic mound like that in the midst of an
      absolutely flat marsh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other house quite like it in England,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose
      it is really a wonderful place. Have you looked at the pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not carefully,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must before you leave,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin is a great judge,
      and so was his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their road curved a little to the sea, and at its last bend they were
      close to the pebbly ridge on which the Tower was built. He touched the
      electric bell and stopped the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let us walk along and have a look at my queer possession once more,&rdquo;
       he begged. &ldquo;Luncheon, you told me, is not till half-past one, and it is a
      quarter to now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment and then assented. They left the car and walked
      along the little track, bordered with white posts, which led on to the
      ridge. To their right was the village, separated from them only by one
      level stretch of meadowland; in the background, the hall. They turned
      along the raised dike just inside the pebbly beach, and she showed her
      companion the narrow waterway up to the village. At its entrance was a
      tall iron upright, with a ladder attached and a great lamp at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to show them the way in at night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin had it placed there. And yet,&rdquo; she went
      on, &ldquo;curiously enough, since it was erected, there have been more wrecks
      than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem a dangerous beach,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a spot about fifty yards from the Tower. It was the spot to
      which the woman whom he had met on the day of his arrival had pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they are always out of sight, even when
      the tide is at the lowest&mdash;but there are some hideous sunken rocks
      there. &lsquo;The Daggers,&rsquo; they call them. One or two fishing boats have been
      lost on them, trying to make the village. When Mr. Fentolin put up the
      lamp, every one thought that it would be quite safe to try and get in at
      night. This winter, though, there have been three wrecks which no one
      could understand. It must be something in the currents, or a sort of
      optical illusion, because in the last shipwreck one man was saved, and he
      swore that at the time they struck the rock, they were headed straight for
      the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the Tower now. Hamel became a little absorbed. They
      walked around it, and he tried the front door. He found, as he had
      expected, that it opened readily. He looked around him for several
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle has been here this morning,&rdquo; he remarked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That outhouse,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;must be quite a large place. Have you any
      idea what it is he works upon there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin has been preparing for my coming,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I see that
      he has moved a few of his personal things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, only she shivered a little as she stepped back into the
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you like my little domicile,&rdquo; he remarked, as they
      started off homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she admitted curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the train,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;you seemed rather to discourage my
      coming here. Yet last night, after dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wrong,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I should have said nothing, and yet I
      couldn&rsquo;t help it. I don&rsquo;t suppose it will make any difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make any difference to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Only I have a strange antipathy to
      the place. I don&rsquo;t like it. My uncle sometimes shuts himself up here for
      quite a long time. We have an idea, Gerald and I, that things happen here
      sometimes which no one knows of. When he comes back, he is moody and
      ill-tempered, or else half mad with excitement. He isn&rsquo;t always the
      amiable creature whom you have met. He has the face of an angel, but there
      are times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about him,&rdquo; Hamel begged, as her voice faltered.
      &ldquo;Now that I am going to stay in the neighbourhood for a few days, you must
      please remember that it is partly your responsibility. You are not going
      to shut yourself up, are you? You&rsquo;ll come and play golf again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he will let me,&rdquo; she promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he will let you, right enough,&rdquo; Hamel observed. &ldquo;Between you and
      me, I rather think he hates having me down at the Tower at all. He will
      encourage anything that takes me away, even as far as the Golf Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were approaching the Hall now. She was looking once more as she had
      looked last night. She had lost her colour, her walk was no longer
      buoyant. She had the air of a prisoner who, after a brief spell of
      liberty, enters once more the place of his confinement. Gerald came out to
      meet them as they climbed the stone steps which led on to the terrace. He
      glanced behind as he greeted them, and then almost stealthily took a
      telegram from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This came for you,&rdquo; he remarked, handing it to Hamel. &ldquo;I met the boy
      bringing it out of the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel tore it open, with a word of thanks. Gerald stood in front of him as
      he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind putting it away at once,&rdquo; he asked, a little
      uncomfortably. &ldquo;You see, the telegraph office is in the place, and my
      uncle has a queer rule that every telegram is brought to him before it is
      delivered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel did not speak for a moment. He was looking at the few words scrawled
      across the pink sheet with a heavy black pencil:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Make every enquiry in your neighbourhood
    for an American, John P. Dunster, entrusted
    with message of great importance, addressed to
    Von Dusenberg, The Hague.  Is believed to
    have been in railway accident near Wymondham
    and to have been taken from inn by young man
    in motor-car.  Suggest that he is being
    improperly detained.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamel crumpled up the telegram and thrust it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-by,&rdquo; he asked, as they ascended the steps, &ldquo;what did you say the
      name of this poor fellow was who is lying ill up-stairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald hesitated for a moment. Then he answered as though a species of
      recklessness had seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called himself Mr. John P. Dunster.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, having succeeded in getting rid of his niece and his
      somewhat embarrassing guest for at least two hours, was seated in his
      study, planning out a somewhat strenuous morning, when his privacy was
      invaded by Doctor Sarson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our guest,&rdquo; the latter announced, in his usual cold and measured tones,
      &ldquo;has sent me to request that you will favour him with an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin laid his pen deliberately down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Very well, Sarson, I am at his service. Say that
      I will come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin lost no time in paying this suggested visit. Mr. John P.
      Dunster, shaved and clothed, was seated in an easy-chair drawn up to the
      window of his room, smoking what he was forced to confess was a very
      excellent cigar. He turned his head as the door opened, and Mr. Fentolin
      waved his hand pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;this is most agreeable. I had an idea, Mr.
      Dunster, that I should find you a reasonable person. Men of your eminence
      in their profession usually are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster looked at the speaker curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what might my profession be, Mr. Fentolin?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You seem to
      know a great deal about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted. &ldquo;I do know a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster knocked the ash from his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been the hearer of several important
      communications from my side of the Atlantic to England and to the
      Continent, and I have always known that there was a certain amount of risk
      in the business. Once I had an exceedingly narrow shave,&rdquo; he continued
      reminiscently, &ldquo;but this is the first time I have ever been dead up
      against it, and I don&rsquo;t mind confessing that you&rsquo;ve fairly got me puzzled.
      Who the mischief are you, Mr. Fentolin, and what are you interfering
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am what you see,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am one of those unfortunate human
      beings who, by reason of their physical misfortunes, are cut off from the
      world of actual life. I have been compelled to seek distraction in strange
      quarters. I have wealth&mdash;great wealth I suppose I should say; an
      inordinate curiosity, a talent for intrigue. As to the direction in which
      I carry on my intrigues, or even as to the direct interests which I study,
      that is a matter, Mr. Dunster, upon which I shall not gratify your
      curiosity nor anybody else&rsquo;s. But, you see, I am admitting freely that it
      does interest me to interfere in great affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how on earth did you get to know about me,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster asked, &ldquo;and
      my errand? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have got me here in an ordinary way. It
      was an entire fluke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you speak with some show of reason. I have a nephew whom you have
      met, who is devoted to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gerald Fentolin,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster remarked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;Well, I admit frankly the truth of
      what you say. Your&mdash;shall we say capture, was by way of being a
      gigantic fluke. My nephew&rsquo;s instructions simply were to travel down by the
      train to Harwich with you, to endeavour to make your acquaintance, to
      follow you on to your destination, and, if any chance to do so occurred,
      to relieve you of your pocket-book. That, however, I never ventured to
      expect. What really happened was, as you have yourself suggested, almost
      in the nature of a miracle. My nephew showed himself to be possessed of
      gifts which were a revelation to me. He not only succeeded in travelling
      with you by the special train, but after its wreck he was clever enough to
      bring you here, instead of delivering you over to the mercies of a village
      doctor. I really cannot find words to express my appreciation of my
      nephew&rsquo;s conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster muttered, &ldquo;very easily!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps our points of view might differ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have spent a very agreeable few minutes in explanations,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster
      continued. &ldquo;Would it be asking too much if I now suggest that we remove
      the buttons from our foils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assented smoothly. &ldquo;Your first question to
      yourself, under these circumstances, would naturally be: &lsquo;What does Mr.
      Fentolin want with me?&rsquo; I will answer that question for you. All that I
      ask&mdash;it is really very little&mdash;is the word agreed upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster held his cigar a little way off and looked steadfastly at his
      host for a moment. &ldquo;So you have interpreted my cipher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin spread out the palms of his hands in a delicate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one of the simplest, I think, that was
      ever strung together. I am somewhat of an authority upon ciphers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster went on, although his cigar was burning itself
      out, &ldquo;that you have broken the seal of my dispatches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin closed his eyes as though he had heard a discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so clumsy as that, I hope,&rdquo; he murmured gently. &ldquo;I will not
      insult a person of your experience and intelligence by enumerating the
      various ways in which the seal of a dispatch may be liquefied. It is quite
      true that I have read with much pleasure the letter which you are carrying
      from a certain group of very distinguished men to a certain person now in
      The Hague. The letter, however, is replaced in its envelope; the seal is
      still there. You need have no fears whatever concerning it. All that I
      require is that one word from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I give you that one word?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you give it me, as I think you will,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied suavely, &ldquo;I
      shall then telegraph to my agent, or rather I should say to a dear friend
      of mine who lives at The Hague, and that single word will be cabled by him
      from The Hague to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that case,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster enquired, &ldquo;what would become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would give us the great pleasure of your company here for a very
      brief visit,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin answered. &ldquo;We should, I can assure you, do our
      very best to entertain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the dispatch which I am carrying to The Hague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would remain here with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster knocked the ash from his cigar. Without being a man of great
      parts, he was a shrewd person, possessed of an abundant stock of common
      sense. He applied himself, for a few moments, to a consideration of this
      affair, without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you must really forgive me, but I
      can&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re driving at. You are an Englishman, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an Englishman,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin confessed &ldquo;or rather,&rdquo; he added, with
      ghastly humour, &ldquo;I am half an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, I am sure,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued, &ldquo;a person of intelligence, a
      well-read person, a person of perceptions. Surely you can see and
      appreciate the danger with which your country is threatened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to political affairs,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted, &ldquo;I consider
      myself unusually well posted&mdash;in fact, the study of the diplomatic
      methods of the various great Powers is rather a hobby of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster persisted, &ldquo;you do not wish this letter delivered to
      that little conference in The Hague, which you must be aware is now
      sitting practically to determine the fate of your nation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied, &ldquo;I do not intend, that that letter
      shall be delivered. Why do you worry about my point of view? I may have a
      dozen reasons. I may believe that it will be good for my country to suffer
      a little chastisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you may,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster suggested, glancing keenly at his host, &ldquo;be the
      paid agent of some foreign Power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My means,&rdquo; he pointed out, &ldquo;should place me above such suspicion. My
      income, I really believe, is rather more than fifty thousand pounds a
      year. I should not enter into these adventures, which naturally are not
      entirely dissociated from a certain amount of risk, for the purposes of
      financial gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster was still mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted that you do so from pure love of adventure,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I
      still cannot see why you should range yourself on the side of your
      country&rsquo;s enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin observed, &ldquo;even that may become clear to you. At
      present, well&mdash;just that word, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;I do not think so. I cannot make up my mind to tell you
      that word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin gave no sign of annoyance or even disappointment. He simply
      sighed. His eyes were full of a gentle sympathy, his face indicated a
      certain amount of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You distress me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Perhaps it is my fault. I have not made
      myself sufficiently clear. The knowledge of that word is a necessity to
      me. Without it I cannot complete my plans. Without it I very much fear,
      dear Mr. Dunster, that your sojourn among us may be longer than you have
      any idea of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster laughed a little derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve passed those days,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best to enter into
      the humour of this situation, but there are limits. You can&rsquo;t keep
      prisoners in English country houses, nowadays. There are a dozen ways of
      communicating with the outside world, and when that&rsquo;s once done, it seems
      to me that the position of Squire Fentolin of St. David&rsquo;s Hall might be a
      little peculiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled, very slightly, still very blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my stalwart friend, I fear that you are by nature an optimist! I am
      not a betting man, but I am prepared to bet you a hundred pounds to one
      that you have made your last communication with the outside world until I
      say the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster was obviously plentifully supplied with either courage or
      bravado, for he only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better make up your mind at once, Mr. Fentolin, how soon
      that word is to be spoken, or you may lose your money,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat very quietly in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, then,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you do not intend to humour me in this
      little matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster assured him, &ldquo;to part with that word to you
      or to any one else in the the world. When my message has been presented to
      the person to whom it has been addressed, when my trust is discharged,
      then and then only shall I send that cablegram. That moment can only
      arrive at the end of my journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin leaned now a little forward in his chair. His face was still
      smooth and expressionless, but there was a queer sort of meaning in his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of your journey,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;may be nearer than you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not heard of in The Hague to-morrow at the latest,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster
      pointed out, &ldquo;remember that before many more hours have passed, I shall be
      searched for, even to the far corners of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me assure you,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin promised serenely, &ldquo;that though your
      friends search for you up in the skies or down in the bowels of the earth,
      they will not find you. My hiding-places are not as other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster beat lightly with his square, blunt forefinger upon the table
      which stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the sort of talk I understand,&rdquo; he declared curtly. &ldquo;Let us
      understand one another, if we can. What is to happen to me, if I refuse to
      give you that word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin held his hand in front of his eyes, as though to shut out
      some unwelcome vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how unpleasant! Why should you force me to
      disclose my plans? Be content, dear Mr. Dunster, with the knowledge of
      this one fact: we cannot part with you. I have thought it over from every
      point of view, and I have come to that conclusion; always presuming,&rdquo; he
      went on, &ldquo;that the knowledge of that little word of which we have spoken
      remains in its secret chamber of your memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster smoked in silence for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very comfortable here,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You delight me,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cook,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued, &ldquo;has won my heartfelt appreciation.
      Your cigars and wines are fit for any nobleman. Perhaps, after all, this
      little rest is good for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is always a limit fixed, whether it
      be one day, two days, or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A limit to your complacence, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously, then,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster concluded, &ldquo;you wish those who sent me to
      believe that my message has been delivered. Yet there I must confess that
      you puzzle me. What I cannot see is, to put it bluntly, where you come in.
      Any one of the countries represented at this little conference would only
      be the gainers by the miscarriage of my message, which is, without doubt,
      so far as they are concerned, of a distasteful nature. Your own country
      alone could be the sufferer. Now what interest in the world, then, is
      there left&mdash;what interest in the world can you possibly represent&mdash;which
      can be the gainer by your present action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s eyes grew suddenly a little brighter. There was a light
      upon his face strange to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power which is to be the gainer,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;is the power
      encompassed by these walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched his chest; his long, slim fingers were folded upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I meet a man whom I like,&rdquo; he continued softly, &ldquo;I take him into my
      confidence. Picture me, if you will, as a kind of Puck. Haven&rsquo;t you heard
      that with the decay of the body comes sometimes a malignant growth in the
      brain; a Caliban-like desire for evil to fall upon the world; a desire to
      escape from the loneliness of suffering, the isolation of black misery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster let his cigar burn out. He looked steadfastly at this
      strange little figure whose chair had imperceptibly moved a little nearer
      to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what the withholding of this message you carry may mean,&rdquo; Mr.
      Fentolin proceeded. &ldquo;You come here, bearing to Europe the word of a great
      people, a people whose voice is powerful enough even to still the
      gathering furies. I have read your ciphered message. It is what I feared.
      It is my will, mine&mdash;Miles Fentolin&rsquo;s&mdash;that that message be not
      delivered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster muttered under his breath, &ldquo;whether you are in
      earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your heart,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin told him, &ldquo;you know that I am. I can see the
      truth in your face. Now, for the first time, you begin to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a certain extent,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster admitted. &ldquo;Where I am still in the
      dark, however, is why you should expect that I should become your
      confederate. It is true that by holding me up and obstructing my message,
      you may bring about the evil you seek, but unless that word is cabled back
      to New York, and my senders believe that my message has been delivered,
      there can be no certainty. What has been trusted to me as the safest means
      of transmission, might, in an emergency, be committed to a cable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent reasoning,&rdquo; Fentolin agreed. &ldquo;For the very reasons you name
      that word will be given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s face was momentarily troubled. There was something in the
      still, cold emphasis of this man&rsquo;s voice which made him shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin went on, &ldquo;that I spend a great fortune buying
      the secrets of the world, that I live from day to day with the risk of
      ignominious detection always hovering about me&mdash;do you think that I
      do this and am yet unprepared to run the final risks of life and death?
      Have you ever talked with a murderer, Mr. Dunster? Has curiosity ever
      taken you within the walls of Sing Sing? Have you sat within the cell of a
      doomed man and felt the thrill of his touch, of his close presence? Well,
      I will not ask you those questions. I will simply tell you that you are
      talking to one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster had forgotten his extinct cigar. He found it difficult to
      remove his eyes from Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face. He was half fascinated, half
      stirred with a vague, mysterious fear. Underneath these wild words ran
      always that hard note of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be in earnest,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assured him quietly. &ldquo;I have more than once been
      instrumental in bringing about the death of those who have crossed my
      purposes. I plead guilty to the weakness of Nero. Suffering and death are
      things of joy to me. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster said slowly, &ldquo;that I ought not to wring your
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled. His chair receded an inch or two. There was never a
      time when his expression had seemed more seraphic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no emergency of that sort,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;for which I am not
      prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His little revolver gleamed for a minute beneath his cuff. He backed his
      chair slowly and with wonderful skill towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will fix the period of your probation, Mr. Dunster, at&mdash;say,
      twenty-four hours,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Please make yourself until then entirely
      at home. My cook, my cellar, my cigar cabinets, are at your disposal. If
      some happy impulse,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;should show you the only reasonable
      course by dinnertime, it would give me the utmost pleasure to have you
      join us at that meal. I can promise you a cheque beneath your plate which
      even you might think worth considering, wine in your glass which kings
      might sigh for, cigars by your side which even your Mr. Pierpont Morgan
      could not buy. Au revoir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and closed. Mr. Dunster sat staring into the open space
      like a man still a little dazed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The beautiful but somewhat austere front of St. David&rsquo;s Hall seemed, in a
      sense, transformed, as Hamel and his companion climbed the worn grey steps
      which led on to the broad sweep of terrace. Evidently visitors had
      recently arrived. A dark, rather good-looking woman, with pleasant round
      face and a ceaseless flow of conversation, was chattering away to Mr.
      Fentolin. By her side stood another woman who was a stranger to Hamel&mdash;thin,
      still elegant, with tired, worn face, and the shadow of something in her
      eyes which reminded him at once of Esther. She wore a large picture hat
      and carried a little Pomeranian dog under her arm. In the background, an
      insignificant-looking man with grey side-whiskers and spectacles was
      beaming upon everybody. Mr. Fentolin waved his hand and beckoned to Hamel
      and Esther as they somewhat hesitatingly approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is one of my fortunate mornings, you see, Esther!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      smiling. &ldquo;Lady Saxthorpe has brought her husband over to lunch. Lady
      Saxthorpe,&rdquo; he added, turning to the woman at his side, &ldquo;let me present to
      you the son of one of the first men to realise the elusive beauty of our
      coast. This is Mr. Hamel, son of Peter Hamel, R.A.&mdash;the Countess of
      Saxthorpe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Saxthorpe, who had been engaged in greeting Esther, held out her hand
      and smiled good-humouredly at Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your father&rsquo;s work quite well,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t wonder
      that you have made a pilgrimage here. They tell me that he painted
      nineteen pictures&mdash;pictures of importance, that is to say&mdash;within
      this little area of ten miles. Do you paint, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Hamel answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Hamel,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin intervened, &ldquo;woos other and sterner
      muses. He fights nature in distant countries, spans her gorges with iron
      bridges, stems the fury of her rivers, and carries to the boundary of the
      world that little twin line of metal which brings men like ants to the
      work-heaps of the universe. My dear Florence,&rdquo; he added, suddenly turning
      to the woman at his other side, &ldquo;for the moment I had forgotten. You have
      not met our guest yet. Hamel, this is my sister-in-law, Mrs. Seymour
      Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand to him, unnaturally thin and white, covered with
      jewels. Again he saw something in her eyes which stirred him vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so nice that you are able to spend a few days with us, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo;
       she said quietly. &ldquo;I am sorry that I have been too indisposed to make your
      acquaintance earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;you must know my young friend here, too.
      Mr. Hamel&mdash;Lord Saxthorpe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter shook hands heartily with the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew your father quite well,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Queer thing, he used to
      hang out for months at a time at that little shanty on the beach there.
      Hardest work in the world to get him away. He came over to dine with us
      once or twice, but we saw scarcely anything of him. I hope his son will
      not prove so obdurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Hamel murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel came into these parts to claim his father&rsquo;s property,&rdquo; Mr.
      Fentolin said. &ldquo;However, I have persuaded him to spend a day or two up
      here before he transforms himself into a misanthrope. What of his golf,
      Esther, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel plays very well, indeed,&rdquo; the girl replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your niece was too good for me,&rdquo; Hamel confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The politeness of this younger generation,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;keeps the truth
      sometimes hidden from us. I perceive that I shall not be told who won.
      Lady Saxthorpe, you are fortunate indeed in the morning you have chosen
      for your visit. There is no sun in the world like an April sun, and no
      corner of the earth where it shines with such effect as here. Look
      steadily to the eastward of that second dike and you will see the pink
      light upon the sands, which baffled every one until our friend Hamel came
      and caught it on his canvas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do see it,&rdquo; Lady Saxthorpe murmured. &ldquo;What eyes you have, Mr. Fentolin!
      What perception for colour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said, &ldquo;I am one of those who benefit by the law
      of compensations. On a morning like this I can spend hours merely feasting
      my eyes upon this prospect, and I can find, if not happiness, the next
      best thing. The world is full of beautiful places, but the strange part of
      it is that beauty has countless phases, and each phase differs in some
      subtle and unexplainable manner from all others. Look with me fixedly,
      dear Lady Saxthorpe. Look, indeed, with more than your eyes. Look at that
      flush of wild lavender, where it fades into the sands on one side, and
      strikes the emerald green of that wet seamoss on the other. Look at the
      liquid blue of that tongue of sea which creeps along its bed through the
      yellow sands, through the dark meadowland, which creeps and oozes and
      widens till in an hour&rsquo;s time it will have become a river. Look at my sand
      islands, virgin from the foot of man, the home of sea-gulls, the islands
      of a day. There may be other and more beautiful places. There is none
      quite like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity you no longer,&rdquo; Lady Saxthorpe asserted fervently. &ldquo;The eyes of
      the artist are a finer possession than the limbs of the athlete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler announced luncheon, and they all trooped in. Hamel found
      himself next to Lady Saxthorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Fentolin has been so kind,&rdquo; she confided to him as they took
      their places. &ldquo;I came in fear and trembling to ask for a very small cheque
      for my dear brother&rsquo;s diocese. My brother is a colonial bishop, you know.
      Can you imagine what Mr. Fentolin has given me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel wondered politely. Lady Saxthorpe continued with an air of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pounds! Just fancy that&mdash;a thousand pounds! And some
      people say he is so difficult,&rdquo; she went on, dropping her voice. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Hungerford came all the way over from Norwich to beg for the infirmary
      there, and he gave her nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his excuse?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he told her that it was against his principles to give to
      hospitals,&rdquo; Lady Saxthorpe replied. &ldquo;He thinks that they should be
      supported out of the rates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people have queer ideas of charity,&rdquo; Hamel remarked. &ldquo;Now I am
      afraid that if I had been Mr. Fentolin, I would have given the thousand
      pounds willingly to a hospital, but not a penny to a mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin looked suddenly down the table. He was some distance away,
      but his hearing was wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Hamel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;believe me, missions are very wonderful
      things. It is only from a very careful study of their results that I have
      brought myself to be a considerable supporter of those where I have some
      personal knowledge of the organisation. Hospitals, on the other hand,
      provide for the poor what they ought to be able to provide for themselves.
      The one thing to avoid in the giving away of money is pauperisation. What
      do you think, Florence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister-in-law, who was seated at the other end of the table, looked
      across at him with a bright but stereotyped smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, of course, Miles. I always agree with you. Mr. Fentolin
      has the knack of being right about most things,&rdquo; she continued, turning to
      Lord Saxthorpe. &ldquo;His judgment is really wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish we could get him to come and sit on the bench sometimes, then,&rdquo; Lord
      Saxthorpe remarked heartily. &ldquo;Our neighbours in this part of the world are
      not overburdened with brains. By-the-by,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that reminds me.
      You haven&rsquo;t got such a thing as a mysterious invalid in the house, have
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s rather curious silence. Mr. Fentolin was sitting like
      a carved figure, with a glass of wine half raised to his lips. Gerald had
      broken off in the middle of a sentence and was staring at Lord Saxthorpe.
      Esther was sitting perfectly still, her face grave and calm, her eyes
      alone full of fear. Lord Saxthorpe was not an observant man and he
      continued, quite unconscious of the sensation which his question had
      aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds a silly thing to ask you, doesn&rsquo;t it? They&rsquo;re all full of it at
      Wells, though. I sat on the bench this morning and went into the
      police-station for a moment first. Seems they&rsquo;ve got a long dispatch from
      Scotland Yard about a missing man who is supposed to be in this part of
      the world. He came down in a special train on Tuesday night&mdash;the
      night of the great flood&mdash;and his train was wrecked at Wymondham.
      After that he was taken on by some one in a motor-car. Colonel Renshaw
      wanted me to allude to the matter from the bench, but it seemed to me that
      it was an affair entirely for the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As though suddenly realising the unexpected interest which his words had
      caused, Lord Saxthorpe brought his sentence to a conclusion and glanced
      enquiringly around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man could scarcely disappear in a civilised neighbourhood like this,&rdquo;
       Mr. Fentolin remarked quietly, &ldquo;but there is a certain amount of
      coincidence about your question. May I ask whether it was altogether a
      haphazard one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Lord Saxthorpe declared. &ldquo;The idea seems to be that the
      fellow was brought to one of the houses in the neighbourhood, and we were
      all rather chaffing one another this morning about it. Inspector Yardley&mdash;the
      stout fellow with the beard, you know&mdash;was just starting off in his
      dog-cart to make enquiries round the neighbourhood. If any one in fiction
      wants a type of the ridiculous detective, there he is, ready-made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coincidence of your question,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said smoothly, &ldquo;is
      certainly a strange one. The mysterious stranger is within our gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Saxthorpe, who had been out of the conversation for far too long,
      laid down her knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Fentolin!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Fentolin! This is
      really most exciting! Do tell us all about it at once. I thought that the
      man was supposed to have been decoyed away in a motor-car. Do you know his
      name and all about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a few minor points,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin murmured, &ldquo;such as his
      religious convictions and his size in boots, which I could not swear
      about, but so far as regards his name and his occupation, I think I can
      gratify your curiosity. He is a Mr. John P. Dunster, and he appears to be
      the representative of an American firm of bankers, on his way to Germany
      to conclude a loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; Lord Saxthorpe exclaimed wonderingly. &ldquo;The fellow is
      actually here under this roof! But who brought him? How did he find his
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better ask Gerald,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied. &ldquo;He is the abductor. It seems
      that they both missed the train from Liverpool Street, and Mr. Dunster
      invited Gerald to travel down in his special train. Very kind of him, but
      might have been very unlucky for Gerald. As you know, they got smashed up
      at Wymondham, and Gerald, feeling in a way responsible for him, brought
      him on here; quite properly, I think. Sarson has been looking after him,
      but I am afraid he has slight concussion of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remember this all my life,&rdquo; Lord Saxthorpe declared solemnly, &ldquo;as
      one of the most singular coincidences which has ever come within my
      personal knowledge. Perhaps after lunch, Mr. Fentolin, you will let some
      of your people telephone to the police-station at Wells? There really is
      an important enquiry respecting this man. I should not be surprised,&rdquo; he
      added, dropping his voice a little for the benefit of the servants, &ldquo;to
      find that Scotland Yard needed him on their own account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked, &ldquo;he is quite safe, for Sarson tells
      me there is no chance of his being able to travel, at any rate for
      twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Saxthorpe shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to have him in the house?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;a man who is
      really and actually wanted by Scotland Yard? When one considers that
      nothing ever happens here except an occasional shipwreck in the winter and
      a flower-show in the summer, it does sound positively thrilling. I wonder
      what he has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the subject of Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s possible iniquities.
      Meanwhile, a young man carrying his hat in his hand had slipped in past
      the servants and was leaning over Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s chair. He laid two or
      three sheets of paper upon the table and waited while his employer glanced
      them through and dismissed him with a little nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wireless has been busy this morning,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked. &ldquo;We seem
      to have collected about forty messages from different battleships and
      cruisers. There must be a whole squadron barely thirty miles out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really think,&rdquo; Lady Saxthorpe asked, &ldquo;that there is any fear of
      war, do you, Mr. Fentolin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with a certain amount of gravity. &ldquo;Who can tell? The
      papers this morning were bad. This conference at The Hague is still
      unexplained. France&rsquo;s attitude in the matter is especially mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a strong supporter of Lord Roberts,&rdquo; Lord Saxthorpe said, &ldquo;and I
      believe in the vital necessity of some scheme for national service. At the
      same time, I find it hard to believe that a successful invasion of this
      country is within the bounds of possibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you, Lord Saxthorpe,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared smoothly.
      &ldquo;All the same, this Hague Conference is a most mysterious affair. The
      papers this morning are ominously silent about the fleet. From the tangle
      of messages we have picked up, I should say, without a doubt, that some
      form of mobilisation is going on in the North Sea. If Lady Saxthorpe
      thinks it warm enough, shall we take our coffee upon the terrace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The terrace, by all means,&rdquo; her ladyship assented, rising from her place.
      &ldquo;What a wonderful man you are, Mr. Fentolin, with your wireless
      telegraphy, and your telegraph office in the house, and telephones. Does
      it really amuse you to be so modern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a certain extent, yes,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin sighed, as he guided his chair
      along the hall. &ldquo;When my misfortune first came, I used to speculate a good
      deal upon the Stock Exchange. That was really the reason I went in for all
      these modern appliances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What use do you make of them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled quietly. He looked out sea-ward, beyond the sky-line,
      from whence had come to him, through the clouds, that tangle of messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to feel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the turning wheel of life is not
      altogether out of earshot. I like to dabble just a little in the knowledge
      of these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Saxthorpe came strolling up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget to telephone about this guest of yours?&rdquo; he asked
      fussily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is already done,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assured him. &ldquo;My dear sister, why so
      silent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin turned slowly towards him. She, too, had been standing with
      her eyes fixed upon the distant sea-line. Her face seemed suddenly to have
      aged, her forced vivacity to have departed. Her little Pomeranian rubbed
      against her feet in vain. Yet at the sound of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s voice, she
      seemed to come back to herself as though by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking where you were looking,&rdquo; she declared lightly, &ldquo;just trying
      to see a little way beyond. So silly, isn&rsquo;t it? Chow-Chow, you bad little
      dog, come and you shall have your dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She strolled off, humming a tune to herself. Lord Saxthorpe watched her
      with a shadow upon his plain, good-humoured face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow or other,&rdquo; he remarked quietly, &ldquo;Mrs. Fentolin never seems to
      have got over the loss of her husband, does she? How long is it since he
      died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight years,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied. &ldquo;It was just six months after my own
      accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am losing a great deal of sympathy for you, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; Lady
      Saxthorpe confessed, coming over to his side. &ldquo;You have so many resources,
      there is so much in life which you can do. You paint, as we all know,
      exquisitely. They tell me that you play the violin like a master. You have
      unlimited time for reading, and they say that you are one of the greatest
      living authorities upon the politics of Europe. Your morning paper must
      bring you so much that is interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted, &ldquo;that I have compensations which no
      one can guess at, compensations which appeal to me more as time steals on.
      And yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet?&rdquo; Lady Saxthorpe repeated interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin was watching Gerald drive golf balls from the lawn beneath.
      He pointed downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was like that when I was his age,&rdquo; he said quietly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin remained upon the terrace long after the departure of his
      guests. He had found a sunny corner out of the wind, and he sat there with
      a telescope by his side and a budget of newspapers upon his knee. On some
      pretext or another he had detained all the others of the household so that
      they formed a little court around him. Even Hamel, who had said something
      about a walk, had been induced to stop by an appealing glance from Esther.
      Mr. Fentolin was in one of his most loquacious moods. For some reason or
      other, the visit of the Saxthorpes seemed to have excited him. He talked
      continually, with the briefest pauses. Every now and then he gazed
      steadily across the marshes through his telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Saxthorpe,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;has, I must confess, greatly excited my
      curiosity as to the identity of our visitor. Such a harmless-looking
      person, he seems, to be causing such a commotion. Gerald, don&rsquo;t you feel
      your responsibility in the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I do!&rdquo; Gerald replied, with unexpected grimness. &ldquo;I feel my
      responsibility deeply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, who was holding the telescope to his eye, touched Hamel on
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your eyes are better than mine. You see the
      road there? Look along it, between the white posts, as far as you can.
      What do you make of that black speck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel held the telescope to his eye and steadied it upon the little tripod
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like a horse and trap,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      declared. &ldquo;It seemed so to me, but I was not sure. My eyes are weak this
      afternoon. How many people are in the trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Hamel answered. &ldquo;I can see them distinctly now. One man is driving,
      another is sitting by his side. They are coming this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin blew his whistle. Meekins appeared almost directly. His
      master whispered a word in his ear. The man at once departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me make use of your eyes once more,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin begged. &ldquo;About
      these two men in the trap, Mr. Hamel. Is one of them, by any chance,
      wearing a uniform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both are,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;The man who is driving is wearing a
      peaked hat. He looks like a police inspector. The man by his side is an
      ordinary policeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very interesting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let us hope that we shall not see an
      arrest under my roof. I should feel it a reflection upon my hospitality. I
      trust, I sincerely trust, that this visit does not bode any harm to Mr.
      John P. Dunster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald rose impatiently to his feet and swung across the terrace. Mr.
      Fentolin, however, called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald,&rdquo; he advised, &ldquo;better not go away. The inspector may desire to ask
      you questions. You will have nothing to conceal. It was a natural and
      delightful impulse of yours to bring the man who had befriended you, and
      who was your companion in that disaster, straight to your own home for
      treatment and care. It was an admirable impulse, my boy. You have nothing
      to be ashamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell him, too&mdash;&rdquo; Gerald began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s words seemed to be charged with a swift, rapier-like note.
      The boy broke off in his speech. He looked at Hamel and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin murmured, &ldquo;I am sure there is no need for us to
      talk about this poor man as though anybody had done anything wrong in
      having him here. This, I suppose, must be the Inspector Yardley whom Lord
      Saxthorpe spoke of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very intelligent-looking officer, I am sure,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked.
      &ldquo;Gerald, go and meet him, if you please. I should like to speak to him out
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog-cart had drawn up at the front door, and the inspector had already
      alighted. Gerald intervened as he was in the act of questioning the
      butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin would like to speak to you, inspector,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you
      will come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inspector followed Gerald and saluted the little group solemnly. Mr.
      Fentolin held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my telephone message, inspector?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not received any message that I know of, sir,&rdquo; the inspector
      replied. &ldquo;I have come over here in accordance with instructions received
      from headquarters&mdash;in fact from Scotland Yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assented. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come over, I presume, to make
      enquiries concerning Mr. John P. Dunster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the name of the gentleman, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only understood to-day from my friend Lord Saxthorpe,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      continued, &ldquo;that Mr. Dunster was being enquired about as though he had
      disappeared. My nephew brought him here after the railway accident at
      Wymondham, since when he has been under the care of my own physician. I
      trust that you have nothing serious against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first duty, sir,&rdquo; the inspector pronounced, &ldquo;is to see the gentleman
      in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin agreed. &ldquo;Gerald, will you take the inspector
      up to Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s rooms? Or stop, I will go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin started his chair and beckoned the inspector to follow him.
      Meekins, who was waiting inside the hall, escorted them by means of the
      lift to the second floor. They made their way to Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s room. Mr.
      Fentolin knocked softly at the door. It was opened by the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the patient?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson appeared from the interior of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still unconscious,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;Otherwise, the symptoms are favourable.
      He is quite unfit,&rdquo; the doctor added, looking steadily at the inspector,
      &ldquo;to be removed or questioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no idea of anything of the sort,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin explained. &ldquo;It is
      Inspector Yardley&rsquo;s duty to satisfy himself that Mr. Dunster is here. It
      is necessary for the inspector to see your patient, so that he can make
      his report at headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite simple, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please step in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all entered the room, which was large and handsomely furnished.
      Through the open windows came a gentle current of fresh air. Mr. Dunster
      lay in the midst of all the luxury of fine linen sheets and embroidered
      pillow-cases. The inspector looked at him stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he asleep?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the third day of his concussion,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He is still
      unconscious. He will remain in the same condition for another two days.
      After that he will begin to recover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin touched the inspector on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see his clothing at the foot of the bed,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;His linen
      is marked with his name. That is his dressing-case with his name painted
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite satisfied, sir,&rdquo; the inspector announced. &ldquo;I will not intrude
      any further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the room. Mr. Fentolin himself escorted the inspector into the
      library and ordered whisky and cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I am unreasonably curious,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked,
      &ldquo;but is it really true that you have had enquiries from Scotland Yard
      about the poor fellow up-stairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a very important enquiry indeed, sir,&rdquo; the inspector replied. &ldquo;I
      have instructions to telegraph all I have been able to discover,
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my putting it plainly,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked, &ldquo;but is our friend a
      criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as that, sir,&rdquo; the inspector answered. &ldquo;I know of no
      charge against him. I don&rsquo;t know that I have the right to say so much,&rdquo; he
      added, sipping his whisky and soda, &ldquo;but putting two and two together, I
      should rather come to the conclusion that he was a person of some
      political importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a criminal at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as I know of,&rdquo; the inspector assented. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way I read the
      enquiries at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You relieve me,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;Now what about his possessions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man coming down shortly from Scotland Yard,&rdquo; the inspector
      announced, a little gloomily. &ldquo;My orders were to touch nothing, but to
      locate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve succeeded so far,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked. &ldquo;Here he is, and
      here I think he will stay until some days after your friend from Scotland
      Yard can get here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem so, indeed,&rdquo; the inspector agreed. &ldquo;To me he looks terrible
      ill. But there&rsquo;s one thing sure, he&rsquo;s having all the care and attention
      that&rsquo;s possible. And now, sir, I&rsquo;ll not intrude further upon your time.
      I&rsquo;ll just make my report, and you&rsquo;ll probably have a visit from the
      Scotland Yard man sometime within the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin escorted the inspector to his dog-cart, shook hands with him,
      and watched him drive off. Only Mrs. Seymour Fentolin remained upon the
      terrace. He glided over to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Florence,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where are the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel and Esther have gone for a walk,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Gerald has
      disappeared somewhere. Has anything&mdash;is everything all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied easily. &ldquo;All that the inspector desired
      was to see Mr. Dunster. He has seen him. The poor fellow was unfortunately
      unconscious, but our friend will at least be able to report that he was in
      good hands and well cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unconscious,&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin repeated. &ldquo;I thought that he was better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is always subject to those slight relapses in an affair of
      concussion,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin laid down her work and leaned a little towards her
      brother-in-law. Her hand rested upon his. Her voice had fallen to a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;forgive me, but are you sure that you are not getting
      a little out of your depth? Remember that there are some risks which are
      not worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And there are some risks, my dear Florence,
      which are worth every drop of blood in a man&rsquo;s body, and every breath of
      life. The peace of Europe turns upon that man up-stairs. It is worth
      taking a little risk for, worth a little danger. I have made my plans, and
      I mean to carry them through. Tell me, when I was up-stairs, this fellow
      Hamel&mdash;was he talking confidentially to Gerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I trust him,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued. &ldquo;He had a
      telegram yesterday from a man in the Foreign Office, a telegram which I
      did not see. He took the trouble to walk three miles to send the reply to
      it from another office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin protested, &ldquo;you know who he is. You know
      that he is Peter Hamel&rsquo;s son. He had a definite purpose in coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But for that, Mr. Hamel would have found a
      little trouble before now. As it is, he must be watched. If any one comes
      between me and the things for which I am scheming to-day, they will risk
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin sighed. She was watching the figures of Esther and Hamel far
      away in the distance, picking their way across the last strip of marshland
      which lay between them and the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;you take advice from no one. You will go
      your own way, I know. And yet, it seems to me that life holds so many
      compensations for you without your taking these terrible risks. I am not
      thinking of any one else. I am not pleading to you for the sake of any one
      else. I am thinking only of yourself. I have had a sort of feeling ever
      since this man was brought into the house, that trouble would come of it.
      To me the trouble seems to be gathering even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin laughed softly, a little contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presentiments,&rdquo; he scoffed, &ldquo;are the excuses of cowards. Don&rsquo;t be afraid,
      Florence. Remember always that I look ahead. Do you think that I could
      stay here contented with what you call my compensations&mdash;my art, the
      study of beautiful things, the calm epicureanism of the sedate and simple
      life? You know very well that I could not do that. The craving for other
      things is in my heart and blood. The excitement which I cannot have in one
      way, I must find in another, and I think that before many nights have
      passed, I shall lie on my pillow and hear the guns roar, hear the
      footsteps of the great armies of the world moving into battle. It is for
      that I live, Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up her knitting again. Her eyes were fixed upon the sky-line.
      Twice she opened her lips, but twice no words came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You begin to understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him only for a moment and back at her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she sighed.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the middle of that night Hamel sat up in bed, awakened with a sudden
      start by some sound, only the faintest echo of which remained in his
      consciousness. His nerves were tingling with a sense of excitement. He sat
      up in bed and listened. Suddenly it came again&mdash;a long, low moan of
      pain, stifled at the end as though repressed by some outside agency. He
      leaped from his bed, hurried on a few clothes, and stepped out on to the
      landing. The cry had seemed to him to come from the further end of the
      long corridor&mdash;in the direction, indeed, of the room where Mr.
      Dunster lay. He made his way there, walking on tiptoe, although his feet
      fell noiselessly upon the thick carpet. A single light was burning from a
      bracket in the wall, insufficient to illuminate the empty spaces, but
      enough to keep him from stumbling. The corridor towards the south end
      gradually widened, terminating in a splendid high window with stained
      glass, a broad seat, and a table. On the right, the end room was Mr.
      Dunster&rsquo;s apartment, and on the left a flight of stairs led to the floor
      above. Hamel stood quite still, listening. There was a light in the room,
      as he could see from under the door, but there was no sound of any one
      moving. Hamel listened intently, every sense strained. Then the sound of a
      stair creaking behind diverted his attention. He looked quickly around.
      Gerald was descending. The boy&rsquo;s face was white, and his eyes were filled
      with fear. Hamel stepped softly back from the door and met him at the foot
      of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear that cry?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It woke me up. What do you suppose it was?&rdquo; Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one in pain,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. It came from this
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know who sleeps there?&rdquo; Gerald asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man with concussion of the brain doesn&rsquo;t cry out like that. Besides,
      did you hear the end of it? It sounded as though some one were choking
      him. Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had spoken only in bated breath, but the door of the room before
      which they were standing was suddenly opened. Meekins stood there, fully
      dressed, his dark, heavy face full of somber warning. He started a little
      as he saw the two whispering together. Gerald addressed him almost
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both heard the same sound, Meekins. Is any one ill? It sounded like
      some one in pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated. Then from behind his shoulder came Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s
      still, soft voice. There was a little click, and Meekins, as though
      obeying an unseen gesture, stepped back. Mr. Fentolin glided on to the
      threshold. He was still dressed. He propelled his chair a few yards down
      the corridor and beckoned them to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that you should have been disturbed, Mr.
      Hamel. We have been a little anxious about our mysterious guest. Doctor
      Sarson fetched me an hour ago. He discovered that it was necessary to
      perform a very slight operation, merely the extraction of a splinter of
      wood. It is all over now, and I think that he will do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this very plausible explanation, Hamel was conscious of
      the remains of an uneasiness which he scarcely knew how to put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a most distressing cry,&rdquo; he observed doubtfully, &ldquo;a cry of fear as
      well as of pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked compassionately. &ldquo;I am afraid that
      for a moment or two he must have suffered acutely. Doctor Sarson is very
      clever, however, and there is no doubt that what he did was for the best.
      His opinion is that by to-morrow morning there will be a marvellous
      change. Good night, Mr. Hamel. I am quite sure that you will not be
      disturbed again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel neither felt nor showed any disposition to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope that you will not think that I am
      officious or in any way abusing your hospitality, but I cannot help
      suggesting that as Dr. Sarson is purely your household physician, the
      relatives of this man Dunster might be better satisfied if some second
      opinion were called in. Might I suggest that you telephone to Norwich for
      a surgeon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin showed no signs of displeasure. He was silent for a moment,
      as though considering the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sure, Mr. Hamel, that you are not right,&rdquo; he admitted
      frankly. &ldquo;I believe that the case is quite a simple one, but on the other
      hand it would perhaps be more satisfactory to have an outside opinion. If
      Mr. Dunster is not conscious in the morning, we will telephone to the
      Norwich Infirmary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be advisable,&rdquo; Hamel agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said once more. &ldquo;I am sorry that your rest has
      been disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel, however, still refused to take the hint. His eyes were fixed upon
      that closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;have you any objection to my seeing Mr.
      Dunster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s intense silence. A sudden light had burned in Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s eyes. His fingers gripped the side of his chair. Yet when he
      spoke there were no signs of anger in his tone. It was a marvellous effort
      of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why your curiosity should not
      be gratified. Knock softly at the door, Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy obeyed. In a moment or two Doctor Sarson appeared on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our guest, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin explained in a whisper, &ldquo;has been
      awakened by this poor fellow&rsquo;s cry. He would like to see him for a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson opened the door. They all passed in on tiptoe. The doctor
      led the way towards the bed upon which Mr. Dunster was lying, quite still.
      His head was bandaged, and his eyes closed. His face was ghastly. Gerald
      gave vent to a little muttered exclamation. Mr. Fentolin turned to him
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy stood still, trembling, speechless. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s eyes were
      riveted upon him. The doctor was standing, still and dark, a motionless
      image.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he asleep?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is under the influence of a mild anaesthetic,&rdquo; Doctor Sarson
      explained. &ldquo;He is doing very well. His case is quite simple. By to-morrow
      morning he will be able to sit up and walk about if he wishes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked steadily at the figure upon the bed. Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s breathing
      was regular, and his eyes were closed, but his colour was ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look like getting up for a good many days to come,&rdquo; Hamel
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor led the way towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man has a fine constitution,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel sure that if you wish
      you will be able to talk to him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They separated outside in the passage. Mr. Fentolin bade his guest a
      somewhat restrained good night, and Gerald mounted the staircase to his
      room. Hamel, however, had scarcely reached his door before Gerald
      reappeared. He had descended the stair-case at the other end of the
      corridor. He stood for a moment looking down the passage. The doors were
      all closed. Even the light had been extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in for a moment, please?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure! Come in and have a cigarette if you will. I shan&rsquo;t feel
      like sleep for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the room, and Gerald threw himself into an easy-chair near
      the window. Hamel wheeled up another chair and produced a box of
      cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer thing your dropping across that fellow in the way you did,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;Just shows how one may disappear from the world altogether, and
      no one be a bit the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was sitting with folded arms. His expression was one of deep
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I&rsquo;d never brought him here,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I ought to have
      known better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he as well off here as anywhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that he is?&rdquo; Gerald demanded, looking across at Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can scarcely do your uncle the injustice,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;of
      imagining that he can possibly have any reason or any desire to deal with
      that man except as a guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; Gerald asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is getting serious. You and I are
      at cross-purposes. If you like, you shall have the truth from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was warned about your uncle before I came down into this part of the
      world,&rdquo; Hamel continued quietly. &ldquo;I was told that he is a dangerous
      conspirator, a man who sticks at nothing to gain his ends, a person
      altogether out of place in these days. It sounds melodramatic, but I had
      it straight from a friend. Since I have been here, I have had a telegram&mdash;you
      brought it to me yourself&mdash;asking for information about this man
      Dunster. It was I who wired to London that he was here. It was through me
      that Scotland Yard communicated with the police station at Wells, through
      me that a man is to be sent down from London. I didn&rsquo;t come here as a spy&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      think that; I was coming here, anyhow. On the other hand, I believe that
      your uncle is playing a dangerous game. I am going to have Mr. John P.
      Dunster put in charge of a Norwich physician to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; the boy murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Hamel continued, &ldquo;what are you doing in this business,
      anyway? You are old enough to know your own mind and to go your own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that because you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Gerald declared bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a sense I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hamel admitted, &ldquo;and yet your sister hinted to me
      only this afternoon that you and she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what she told you!&rdquo; the boy interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worn the
      chains for the last eight years. They are breaking her. They&rsquo;ve broken my
      mother. Sometimes I think they are breaking me. But, you know, there comes
      a time&mdash;there comes a time when one can&rsquo;t go on. I&rsquo;ve seen some
      strange things here, some that I&rsquo;ve half understood, some that I haven&rsquo;t
      understood at all. I&rsquo;ve closed my eyes. I&rsquo;ve kept my promise. I&rsquo;ve done
      his bidding, where ever it has led me. But you know there is a time&mdash;there
      is a limit to all things. I can&rsquo;t go on. I spied on this man Dunster. I
      brought him here. It is I who am responsible for anything that may happen
      to him. It&rsquo;s the last time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald&rsquo;s face was white with pain. Hamel laid his hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are worse things in the world than breaking a
      promise. When you gave it, the conditions which were existing at the time
      made it, perhaps, a right and reasonable undertaking, but sometimes the
      whole of the conditions under which a promise was given, change. Then one
      must have courage enough to be false even to one&rsquo;s word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you talked to my sister like that?&rdquo; Gerald asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have and I will again,&rdquo; Hamel declared. &ldquo;To-morrow morning I leave this
      house, but before I go I mean to have the affair of this man Dunster
      cleared up. Your uncle will be very angry with me, without a doubt. I
      don&rsquo;t care. But I do want you to trust me, if you will, and your sister. I
      should like to be your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows we need one!&rdquo; the boy said simply. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the house was quiet. Hamel pushed his window wide open and
      looked out into the night. The air was absolutely still, there was no
      wind. The only sound was the falling of the low waves upon the stony beach
      and the faint scrunching of the pebbles drawn back by the ebb. He looked
      along the row of windows, all dark and silent now. A rush of pleasant
      fancies suddenly chased away the grim depression of the last few minutes.
      Out of all this sordidness and mystery there remained at least something
      in life for him to do. A certain aimlessness of purpose which had troubled
      him during the last few months had disappeared. He had found an object in
      life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; Hamel declared, as he stood at the sideboard the following
      morning at breakfast-time and helped himself to bacon and eggs, &ldquo;I am
      positively going to begin reading. I have a case full of books down at the
      Tower which I haven&rsquo;t unpacked yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Esther made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the sunshine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a breath of wind, either. I
      think to-day that I could play from the men&rsquo;s tees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel sighed as he returned to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good intentions are already half dissipated,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we attack the other half?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald, who was also on his way to the sideboard, suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking out of the window. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going away this
      morning, I wonder? There&rsquo;s the Rolls-Royce at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel, too, rose once more to his feet. The two exchanged swift glances.
      Moved by a common thought, they both started for the door, only to find it
      suddenly opened before them. Mr. Fentolin glided into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; Gerald exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glanced keenly around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, everybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My appearance at this hour of the
      morning naturally surprises you. As a matter of fact, I have been up for
      quite a long time. Esther dear, give me some coffee, will you, and be sure
      that it is hot. If any of you want to say good-by to Mr. John P. Dunster,
      you&rsquo;d better hurry out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he is going?&rdquo; Hamel asked incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted. &ldquo;I wash my hands of the man. He has
      given us an infinite amount of trouble, has monopolised Doctor Sarson when
      he ought to have been attending upon me&mdash;a little more hot milk, if
      you please, Esther&mdash;and now, although he really is not fit to leave
      his room, he insists upon hurrying off to keep an appointment somewhere on
      the Continent. The little operation we spoke of last night was successful,
      as Doctor Sarson prophesied, and Mr. Dunster was quite conscious and able
      to sit up early this morning. We telephoned at six o&rsquo;clock to Norwich for
      a surgeon, who is now on his way over here, but he will not wait even to
      see him. What can you do with a man so obstinate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Hamel nor Gerald had resumed their places. The former, after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation, turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I should like to see the last of Mr. Dunster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin begged. &ldquo;I have said good-by to him myself, and
      all that I hope is that next time you offer a wayfarer the hospitality of
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall, Gerald, he may be a more tractable person. This morning
      I shall give myself a treat. I shall eat an old-fashioned English
      breakfast. Close the door after you, if you please, Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel, with Gerald by his side, hurried out into the hall. Just as they
      crossed the threshold they saw Mr. Dunster, wrapped from head to foot in
      his long ulster, a soft hat upon his head and one of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s cigars
      in his mouth, step from the bottom stair into the hall and make his way
      with somewhat uncertain footsteps towards the front door. Doctor Sarson
      walked on one side, and Meekins held him by the arm. He glanced towards
      Gerald and his companion and waved the hand which held his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, my young friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve got them to let
      me make a start. Next time we go about the country in a saloon car
      together, I hope we&rsquo;ll have better luck. Say, but I&rsquo;m groggy about the
      knees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better save your breath,&rdquo; Doctor Sarson advised him grimly. &ldquo;You
      haven&rsquo;t any to spare now, and you&rsquo;ll want more than you have before you
      get to the end of your journey. Carefully down the steps, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They helped him into the car. Hamel and Gerald stood under the great stone
      portico, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m jiggered!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown. To his surprise,
      neither Doctor Sarson nor Meekins were accompanying the departing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off, right enough,&rdquo; Hamel declared, as the car glided away. &ldquo;Do you
      understand it? I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald did not speak for several moments. His eyes were still fixed upon
      the back of the disappearing car. Then he turned towards Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that Mr. Fentolin doesn&rsquo;t know. If
      that detective was really on his way here, there wasn&rsquo;t any chance of
      keeping Mr. Dunster to himself. You see, the whole story is common
      property. And yet, there&rsquo;s something about the affair that bothers me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me,&rdquo; Hamel admitted, watching the car until it became a speck in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was fairly well cornered,&rdquo; Gerald concluded, as they made their way
      back to the dining-room, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t like him to let go of anything so
      easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve seen the last of our guest,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked, as Hamel
      and Gerald re-entered the dining-room. &ldquo;A queer fellow&mdash;almost a new
      type to me. Dogged and industrious, I should think. He hadn&rsquo;t the least
      right to travel, you know, and I think so long as we had taken the trouble
      to telephone to Norwich, he might have waited to see the physician. Sarson
      was very angry about it, but what can you do with these fellows who are
      never ill? They scarcely know what physical disability means. Well, Mr.
      Hamel, and how are you going to amuse yourself to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought of commencing some reading I brought with me,&rdquo; Hamel
      replied, &ldquo;but Miss Esther has challenged me to another game of golf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;It is very kind of you indeed, Mr.
      Hamel. It is always a matter of regret for me that society in these parts
      is so restricted. My nephew and niece have little opportunity for enjoying
      themselves. Play golf with Mr. Hamel, by all means, my dear child,&rdquo; he
      continued, turning to his niece. &ldquo;Make the most of this glorious spring
      weather. And what about you, Gerald? What are you doing to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet, sir,&rdquo; the boy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always that lack of initiative,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A lack of initiative is
      one of your worst faults, I am afraid, dear Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up quickly. For a moment it seemed as though he were about
      to make a fierce reply. He met Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s steady gaze, however, and
      the words died away upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather thought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of going into Norwich, if you could spare
      me. Captain Holt has asked me to lunch at the Barracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most unfortunate,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have a commission for you later
      in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald continued his breakfast in silence. He bent over his plate so that
      his face was almost invisible. Mr. Fentolin was peeling a peach. A servant
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Godfrey, sir,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all looked up. A trim, clean-shaven, hard-featured young man in naval
      uniform was standing upon the threshold. He bowed to Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry to intrude, sir, at this hour of the morning,&rdquo; he said
      briskly. &ldquo;Lieutenant Godfrey, my name. I am flag lieutenant of the
      Britannia. You can&rsquo;t see her, but she&rsquo;s not fifty miles off at this
      minute. I landed at Sheringham this morning, hired a car and made the best
      of my way here. Message from the Admiral, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are delighted to see you, Lieutenant Godfrey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have some
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, sir,&rdquo; the officer answered. &ldquo;Business first. I&rsquo;ll
      breakfast afterwards, with pleasure, if I may. The Admiral&rsquo;s compliments,
      and he would take it as a favour if you would haul down your wireless for
      a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haul down my wireless,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are doing a lot of manoeuvring within range of you, and likely to do a
      bit more,&rdquo; the young man explained. &ldquo;You are catching up our messages all
      the time. Of course, we know they&rsquo;re quite safe with you, but things get
      about. As yours is only a private installation, we&rsquo;d like you, if you
      don&rsquo;t mind, sir, to shut up shop for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin seemed puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;we are not at war, are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the young officer replied, &ldquo;but God knows when we shall be! We
      are under sealed orders, anyway, and we don&rsquo;t want any risk of our plans
      leaking out. That&rsquo;s why we want your wireless disconnected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need say no more,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin assured him. &ldquo;The matter is already
      arranged. Esther, let me present Lieutenant Godfrey&mdash;my niece, Miss
      Fentolin; Mr. Gerald Fentolin, my nephew; Mr. Hamel, a guest. See that
      Lieutenant Godfrey has some breakfast, Gerald. I will go myself and see my
      Marconi operator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully good of you, sir,&rdquo; the young man declared, &ldquo;and I am sure we are
      very sorry to trouble you. In a week or two&rsquo;s time you can go into
      business again as much as you like. It&rsquo;s only while we are fiddling around
      here that the Admiral&rsquo;s jumpy about things. May my man have a cup of
      coffee, sir? I&rsquo;d like to be on the way back in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin halted his chair by the side of the bell, and rang it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray make use of my house as your own, sir,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;From what
      you leave unsaid, I gather that things are more serious than the papers
      would have us believe. Under those circumstances, I need not assure you
      that any help we can render is entirely yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin left the room. Lieutenant Godfrey was already attacking his
      breakfast. Gerald leaned towards him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there really going to be war?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask those chaps at The Hague,&rdquo; Lieutenant Godfrey answered. &ldquo;Doing their
      best to freeze us out, or something. All I know is, if there&rsquo;s going to be
      fighting, we are ready for them. By-the-by, what have you got wireless
      telegraphy for here, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fad of my uncle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Gerald replied. &ldquo;Since his accident he amuses
      himself in all sorts of queer ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Godfrey nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I heard he was a cripple, or something of the
      sort. Forgive my asking, but&mdash;you people are English, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; Gerald answered. &ldquo;The Fentolins have lived here for hundreds of
      years. Why do you ask that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Godfrey hesitated. He looked, for the moment, scarcely at his
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The old man was very anxious I should
      find out. You see, a lot of information seems to have got over on the
      other side, and we couldn&rsquo;t think where it had leaked out, except through
      your wireless. However, that isn&rsquo;t likely, of course, unless you&rsquo;ve got
      one of these beastly Germans in your receiving-room. Now if I can borrow a
      cigarette, a cigar, or a pipe of tobacco&mdash;any mortal thing to smoke&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      be off, if I may. The old man turned me out at an unearthly hour this
      morning, and in Sheringham all the shops were closed. Steady on, young
      fellow,&rdquo; he laughed, as Gerald filled his pockets with cigarettes. &ldquo;Well,
      here&rsquo;s good morning to you, Miss Fentolin. Good morning, sir. How long
      ought it to take me to get to Sheringham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty minutes,&rdquo; Gerald told him, &ldquo;if your car&rsquo;s any good at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; was the somewhat dubious reply. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ll shove
      along. You in the Service?&rdquo; he enquired, as they walked down the hall
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I shall be before long,&rdquo; Gerald answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the army,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have to hurry up, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little difficult for me. Here&rsquo;s your car. Good luck to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My excuses to Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; Lieutenant Godfrey shouted, &ldquo;and many
      thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped into the automobile and was soon on his way back. Gerald watched
      him until he was nearly out of sight. On the knoll, two of the wireless
      operators were already at work. Mr. Fentolin sat in his chair below,
      watching. The blue sparks were flashing. A message was just being
      delivered. Presently Mr. Fentolin turned his chair, and with Meekins by
      his side, made his way back to the house. He passed along the hall and
      into his study. Gerald, who was on his way to the dining-room, heard the
      ring of the telephone bell and the call for the trunk special line. He
      hesitated for a moment. Then he made his way slowly down towards the study
      and stood outside the door, listening. In a moment he heard Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s
      clear voice, very low yet very penetrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Mediterranean Fleet will be forty-seven hours before it comes
      together,&rdquo; was the message he heard. &ldquo;The Channel Fleet will manoeuvre off
      Sheerness, waiting for it. The North Sea Fleet is seventeen units under
      nominal strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald turned the handle of the door slowly and entered. Mr. Fentolin was
      just replacing the receiver on its stand. He looked up at his nephew, and
      his eyebrows came together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I allow no
      one in here when I am telephoning on the private wire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald closed the door behind him and summoned up all his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because I have heard what you were saying over the telephone that I
      am here,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I want to know to whom you were sending that
      message which you have intercepted outside.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat for a moment in his chair with immovable face. Then he
      pointed to the door, which Gerald had left open behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close that door, Gerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy obeyed. Mr. Fentolin waited until he had turned around again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and stand over here by the side of the table,&rdquo; he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerald came without hesitation. He stood before his uncle with folded
      arms. There was something else besides sullenness in his face this
      morning, something which Mr. Fentolin was quick to recognise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite understand the nature of your question, Gerald,&rdquo; Mr.
      Fentolin began. &ldquo;It is unlike you. You do not seem yourself. Is there
      anything in particular the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; Gerald answered firmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why this naval
      fellow should come here and ask you to close up your wireless because
      secrets have been leaking out, and a few moments afterwards you should be
      picking up a message and telephoning to London information which was
      surely meant to be private. That&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ve come to ask you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard the message, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You listened&mdash;at the keyhole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listened outside,&rdquo; Gerald assented doggedly. &ldquo;I am glad I listened. Do
      you mind answering my question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I mind!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin repeated softly. &ldquo;Really, Gerald, your
      politeness, your consideration, your good manners, astound me. I am
      positively deprived of the power of speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here till it comes to you again, then,&rdquo; the boy declared
      bluntly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited on you hand and foot, done dirty work for you, put
      up with your ill-humours and your tyranny, and never grumbled. But there
      is a limit! You&rsquo;ve made a poor sort of creature of me, but even the worm
      turns, you know. When it comes to giving away secrets about the movements
      of our navy at a time when we are almost at war, I strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melodramatic, almost dramatic, but, alas! so inaccurate,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      sighed. &ldquo;Is this a fit of the heroics, boy, or what has come over you?
      Have you by any chance&mdash;forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s voice seemed suddenly to have grown in volume. His eyes
      dilated, he himself seemed to have grown in size. Gerald stepped a little
      back. He was trembling, but his expression had not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten. There&rsquo;s a great debt we are doing our best to
      pay, but there&rsquo;s such a thing as asking too much, there&rsquo;s such a thing as
      drawing the cords to snapping point. I&rsquo;m speaking for Esther and mother as
      well as myself. We have been your slaves; in a way I suppose we are
      willing to go on being your slaves. It&rsquo;s the burden that Fate has placed
      around our necks, and we&rsquo;ll go through with it. All I want to point out is
      that there are limits, and it seems to me that we are up against them
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded. He had the air of a man who wishes to be reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very young indeed. Perhaps that is
      my fault for not having let you see more of the world. You have got some
      very queer ideas into your head. A little too much novel reading lately,
      eh? I might treat you differently. I might laugh at you and send you out
      of the room. I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you ask. I&rsquo;ll explain what you
      find so mysterious. The person to whom I have been speaking is my
      stockbroker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your stockbroker!&rdquo; Gerald exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bayliss,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;of the firm of Bayliss, Hundercombe &amp;
      Dunn, Throgmorton Court. Mr. Bayliss is a man of keen perceptions. He
      understands exactly the effect of certain classes of news upon the market.
      The message which I have just sent to him is practically common property.
      It will be in the Daily Mail to-morrow morning. The only thing is that I
      have sent it to him just a few minutes sooner than any one else can get
      it. There is a good deal of value in that, Gerald. I do not mind telling
      you that I have made a large fortune through studying the political
      situation and securing advance information upon matters of this sort. That
      fortune some day will probably be yours. It will be you who will benefit.
      Meanwhile, I am enriching myself and doing no one any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know,&rdquo; Gerald persisted, &ldquo;that this message would ever
      have found its way to the Press? It was simply a message from one
      battleship to another. It was not intended to be picked up on land. There
      is no other installation but ours that could have picked it up. Besides,
      it was in code. I know that you have the code, but the others haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin yawned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingenious, my dear Gerald, but inaccurate. You do not know that the
      message was in code, and in any case it was liable to be picked up by any
      steamer within the circle. You really do treat me, my boy, rather as
      though I were a weird, mischief-making person with a talent for intrigue
      and crime of every sort. Look at your suspicions last night. I believe
      that you and Mr. Hamel had quite made up your minds that I meant evil
      things for Mr. John P. Dunster. Well, I had my chance. You saw him
      depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about his papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will admit,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied, &ldquo;that I read his papers. They were
      of no great consequence, however, and he has taken them away with him. Mr.
      Dunster, as a matter of fact, turned out to be rather a mare&rsquo;s-nest. Now,
      come, since you are here, finish everything you have to say to me. I am
      not angry. I am willing to listen quite reasonably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he declared bitterly. &ldquo;You always get the best of it. I&rsquo;ll
      only ask you one more question. Are you having the wireless hauled down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin pointed out of the window. Gerald followed his finger. Three
      men were at work upon the towering spars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued tolerantly, &ldquo;that I am keeping my word
      to Lieutenant Godfrey. You are suffering from a little too much
      imagination, I am afraid. It is really quite a good fault. By-the-by, how
      do you get on with our friend Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen much of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and Esther are together a great deal, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to be quite friendly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Mr. Hamel, by any chance, who has been putting these ideas into
      your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has been putting any ideas into my head,&rdquo; Gerald answered hotly.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply what I&rsquo;ve seen and overheard. It&rsquo;s simply what I feel around,
      the whole atmosphere of the place, the whole atmosphere you seem to create
      around you with these brutes Sarson and Meekins; and those white-faced,
      smooth-tongued Marconi men of yours, who can&rsquo;t talk decent English; and
      the post-office man, who can&rsquo;t look you in the face; and Miss Price, who
      looks as though she were one of the creatures, too, of your torture
      chamber. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin waited until he had finished. Then he waved him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and take a long walk, Gerald,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Fresh air is what you
      need, fresh air and a little vigorous exercise. Run along now and send
      Miss Price to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald overtook Hamel upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time,&rdquo; the latter remarked, &ldquo;I suppose that our friend Mr.
      Dunster is upon the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald nodded silently. They passed along the corridor. The door of the
      room which Mr. Dunster had occupied was ajar. As though by common consent,
      they both stopped and looked in. The windows were all wide open, the bed
      freshly made. The nurse was busy collecting some medicine bottles and
      fragments of lint. She looked at them in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunster has left, sir,&rdquo; she told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw him go,&rdquo; Gerald replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a quick recovery, wasn&rsquo;t it, nurse?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a recovery at all, sir,&rdquo; the woman declared sharply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d no
      right to have been taken away. It&rsquo;s my opinion Doctor Sarson ought to be
      ashamed of himself to have permitted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t exactly make a prison of the place, could they?&rdquo; Hamel
      pointed out. &ldquo;The man, after all, was only a guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it may be, sir,&rdquo; the nurse replied. &ldquo;All the same, those that
      won&rsquo;t obey their doctors aren&rsquo;t fit to be allowed about alone. That&rsquo;s the
      way I look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin was passing along the corridor as they issued from the room.
      She started a little as she saw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you two been doing in there?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just passing,&rdquo; Hamel explained. &ldquo;We stopped for a moment to speak
      to the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunster has gone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You saw him go, Gerald. You saw him,
      too, didn&rsquo;t you, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; Hamel admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin pointed to the great north window near which they were
      standing, through which the clear sunlight streamed a little pitilessly
      upon her worn face and mass of dyed hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought neither of you to be indoors for a minute on a morning like
      this,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Esther is waiting for you in the car, I think, Mr.
      Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerald passed on up the stairs to his room, but Hamel lingered. A curious
      impulse of pity towards his hostess stirred him. The morning sunlight
      seemed to have suddenly revealed the tragedy of her life. She stood there,
      a tired, worn woman, with the burden heavy upon her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not come out with Miss Fentolin and me?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;We could
      lunch at the Golf Club, out on the balcony. I wish you would. Can&rsquo;t you
      manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin does not like to be left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the finality of her words seemed to him curiously eloquent of
      her state of mind. She did not move on. She seemed, indeed, to have the
      air of one anxious to say more. In that ruthless light, the advantages of
      her elegant clothes and graceful carriage were suddenly stripped away from
      her. She was the abject wreck of a beautiful woman, wizened, prematurely
      aged. Nothing remained but the eyes, which seemed somehow to have their
      message for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin is a little peculiar, you know,&rdquo; she went on, her voice
      shaking slightly with the effort she was making to keep it low. &ldquo;He allows
      Esther so little liberty, she sees so few young people of her own age. I
      do not know why he allows you to be with her so much. Be careful, Mr.
      Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice seemed suddenly to vibrate with a curious note of suppressed
      fear. Almost as she finished her speech, she passed on. Her little gesture
      bade him remain silent. As she went up the stairs, she began to hum scraps
      of a little French air.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel sliced his ball at the ninth, and after waiting for a few minutes
      patiently, Esther came to help him look for it. He was standing down on
      the sands, a little apart from the two caddies who were beating out
      various tufts of long grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you help look for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Searching for balls,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;is a caddy&rsquo;s occupation. Both the
      caddies are now busy. Let us sit down here. These sand hummocks are
      delightful. It is perfectly sheltered, and the sun is in our faces. Golf
      is an overrated pastime. Let us sit and watch that little streak of blue
      find its way up between the white posts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall lose our place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank on to the little knoll of sand to which he had pointed, with a
      resigned sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really are a queer person,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You have been playing golf
      this morning as though your very life depended upon it. You have scarcely
      missed a shot or spoken a word. And now, all of a sudden, you want to sit
      on a sand hummock and watch the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been silent,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;because I have been thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be truthful,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;but you wouldn&rsquo;t call it polite,
      would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subject of my thoughts is my excuse. I have been thinking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a single moment her eyes seemed to have caught something of that
      sympathetic light with which he was regarding her. Then she looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it my mashie shots you were worrying about?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; he replied simply. &ldquo;It was you&mdash;you yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, not altogether naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How flattering!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;By-the-by, you are rather a downright
      person, aren&rsquo;t you, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much so,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;that I am going to tell you one or two things
      now. I am going to be very frank indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat suddenly quite still. Her face was turned from him, but for the
      first time since he had known her there was a slight undertone of colour
      in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea of coming into Norfolk.
      I knew about this little shanty of my father&rsquo;s, but I had forgotten all
      about it. I came as the result of a conversation I had with a friend who
      is in the Foreign Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with startled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked quickly. &ldquo;You are Mr. Hamel, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not only am I Richard Hamel, mining engineer,
      but I really have all that reading to do I have spoken about, and I really
      was looking for a quiet spot to do it in. It is true that I had this part
      of the world in my mind, but I do not think that I should ever have really
      decided to come here if it had not been for my friend in London. He was
      very interested indeed directly I mentioned St. David&rsquo;s Tower. Would you
      like to know what he told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Go on, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me a little of the history of your uncle, Mr. Fentolin, and what
      he did not tell me at the time, he has since supplemented. I suppose,&rdquo; he
      added, hesitatingly, &ldquo;that you yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go on. Please speak as though I knew nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Hamel continued, &ldquo;he told me that your uncle was at one time
      in the Foreign Office himself. He seemed to have a most brilliant career
      before him when suddenly there was a terrible scandal. A political secret&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what it was&mdash;had leaked out. There were rumours that it
      had been acquired for a large sum of money by a foreign Power. Mr.
      Fentolin retired to Norfolk, pending an investigation. It was just as that
      time that he met with his terrible accident, and the matter was dropped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend went on to say that during the last few years Mr. Fentolin has
      once again become an object of some suspicion to the head of our Secret
      Service Department. For a long time they have known that he was employing
      agents abroad, and that he was showing the liveliest interest in
      underground politics. They believed that it was a mere hobby, born of his
      useless condition, a taste ministered to, without doubt, by the occupation
      of his earlier life. Once or twice lately they have had reason to change
      their minds. You know, I dare say, in what a terribly disturbed state
      European affairs are just now. Well, my friend had an idea that Mr.
      Fentolin was showing an extraordinary amount of interest in a certain
      conference which we understand is to take place at The Hague. He begged me
      to come down, and to watch your uncle while I was down here, and report to
      him anything that seemed to me noteworthy. Since then I have had a message
      from him concerning the American whom you entertained&mdash;Mr. John P.
      Dunster. It appears that he was the bearer of very important dispatches
      for the Continent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has gone,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Nothing happened to him, after all.
      He went away without a word of complaint. We all saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; Hamel admitted. &ldquo;Mr. Dunster has certainly gone. It
      is rather a coincidence, however, that he should have taken his departure
      just as the enquiries concerning his whereabouts had reached such a stage
      that it had become quite impossible to keep him concealed any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned a little in her place and looked at him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me&mdash;what of your mission? You have had
      an opportunity of studying my uncle. You have even lived under his roof.
      Tell me what you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will tell you frankly that up to now I have
      not succeeded in solving the problem of your uncle&rsquo;s character. To me
      personally he has been most courteous. He lives apparently a studious and
      an unselfish life. I have heard him even spoken of as a philanthropist.
      And yet you three&mdash;you, your mother, and your brother, who are
      nearest to him, who live in his house and under his protection, have the
      air of passing your days in mortal fear of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she exclaimed nervously, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe that! He is
      always very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; Hamel observed drily. &ldquo;And yet you must remember that you,
      too, are afraid of him. I need not remind you of our conversations, but
      there the truth is. You praise his virtues and his charities, you pity
      him, and yet you go about with a load of fear, and&mdash;forgive me&mdash;of
      secret terror in your heart, you and Gerald, too. As for your mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she interrupted suddenly. &ldquo;Why do you bring me here to talk like
      this? You cannot alter things. Nothing can be altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Well, I will tell you the real reason of my
      having brought you here and of my having made this confession. I brought
      you here because I could not bear to go on living, if not under your roof,
      at any rate in the neighbourhood, without telling you the truth. Now you
      know it. I am here to watch Mr. Fentolin. I am going on watching him. You
      can put him on his guard, if you like; I shan&rsquo;t complain. Or you can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused so long that she looked at him. He moved a little closer to her,
      his fingers suddenly gripped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you can marry me and come away from it all,&rdquo; he concluded quietly.
      &ldquo;Forgive me, please&mdash;I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the startled light in her eyes was followed by a delicious
      softness. Her lips were parted, she leaned a little towards him. Then
      suddenly she seemed to remember. She rose with swift alertness to her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we had better play golf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have asked you to marry me,&rdquo; he protested, as he scrambled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your caddy has found your ball a long time ago,&rdquo; she pointed out, walking
      swiftly on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played his shot and caught her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fentolin&mdash;Esther,&rdquo; he pleaded eagerly, &ldquo;do you think that I am
      not in earnest? Because I am. I mean it. Even if I have only known you for
      a few days, it has been enough. I think that I knew it was coming from the
      moment that you stepped into my railway carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew that what was coming?&rdquo; she asked, raising her eyes suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I should care for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve told me,&rdquo; she reminded him, with a queer
      little smile. &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, please! I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that. I don&rsquo;t
      want to have you tell me so. It&rsquo;s all too ridiculous and impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only known you for three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make up for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t&mdash;care about you. I have never thought of any one in that
      way. It is absurd,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to, sometime or other,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you
      travelling with me, show you the world, new worlds, unnamed rivers,
      untrodden mountains. Or do you want to go and see where the little brown
      people live among the mimosa and the cherry blossoms? I&rsquo;ll take you so far
      away that this place and this life will seem like a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her breath caught a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;You know very well&mdash;or rather you don&rsquo;t
      know, perhaps, but I must tell you&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t. I am here, tied
      and bound, and I can&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dear, don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he went on earnestly. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any bond
      so strong that I won&rsquo;t break it for you, no knot I won&rsquo;t untie, if you
      give me the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were climbing slowly on to the tee. He stepped forward and pulled her
      up. Her hand was cold. Her eyes were raised to his, very softly yet almost
      pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say anything more,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;quite bear it
      just now. You know, you must remember&mdash;there is my mother. Do you
      think that I could leave her to struggle alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His caddy, who had teed the ball, and who had regarded the proceedings
      with a moderately tolerant air, felt called upon at last to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d best get on,&rdquo; he remarked, pointing to two figures in the distance,
      &ldquo;or they&rsquo;ll say we&rsquo;ve cut in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel smote his ball far and true. On a more moderate scale she followed
      his example. They descended the steps together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love-making isn&rsquo;t going to spoil our golf,&rdquo; he whispered, smiling, as he
      touched her fingers once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him almost shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this love-making?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together from the eighteenth green towards the club-house. A
      curious silence seemed suddenly to have enveloped them. Hamel was
      conscious of a strange exhilaration, a queer upheaval of ideas, an
      excitement which nothing in his previous life had yet been able to yield
      him. The wonder of it amazed him, kept him silent. It was not until they
      reached the steps, indeed, that he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On our way home&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed suddenly to have stiffened. He looked at her, surprised. She
      was standing quite still, her hand gripping the post, her eyes fixed upon
      the waiting motor-car. The delicate softness had gone from her face. Once
      more that look of partly veiled suffering was there, suffering mingled
      with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she whispered, under her breath. &ldquo;Look! It is Mr. Fentolin! He has
      come for us himself; he is there in the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, a strange little figure lying back among the cushions of the
      great Daimler, raised his hat and waved it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, children,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You see, I am here to fetch you myself.
      The sunshine has tempted me. What a heavenly morning! Come and sit by my
      side, Esther, and fight your battle all over again. That is one of the
      joys of golf, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Hamel. &ldquo;You need not be
      afraid of boring me. To-day is one of my bright days. I suppose that it is
      the sunshine and the warm wind. On the way here we passed some fields. I
      could swear that I smelt violets. Where are you going, Esther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take my clubs to my locker and pay my caddy,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel will do that for you,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;Come and take
      your seat by my side, and let us wait for him. I am tired of being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave up her clubs reluctantly. All the life seemed to have gone from
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t mother come with you?&rdquo; she asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, dear Esther,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;when I started, I had
      a fancy to be alone. I think&mdash;in fact I am sure&mdash;that your
      mother wanted to come. The sunshine, too, was tempting her. Perhaps it was
      selfish of me not to bring her, but then, there is a great deal to be
      forgiven me, isn&rsquo;t there, Esther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; she echoed, looking steadily ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because it occurred to me that, after all, I had my
      duties as your guardian, dear Esther. I am not sure that we can permit
      flirtations, you know. Let me see, how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-one,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a magazine I was reading the other day,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I was
      interested to observe that the modern idea as regards marriage is a
      changed one. A woman, they say, should not marry until she is twenty-seven
      or twenty-eight&mdash;a very excellent idea. I think we agree, do we not,
      on that, Esther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have never thought about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we will make up our minds to agree. Twenty-seven or
      twenty-eight, let us say. A very excellent age! A girl should know her own
      mind by then. And meanwhile, dear Esther, would it be wise, I wonder, to
      see a little less of our friend Mr. Hamel? He leaves us to-day, I think.
      He is very obstinate about that. If he were staying still in the house,
      well, it might be different. But if he persists in leaving us, you will
      not forget, dear, that association with a guest is one thing; association
      with a young man living out of the house is another. A great deal less of
      Mr. Hamel I think that we must see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply whatever. Hamel was coming now towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really a very personable young man,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked, studying him
      through his eyeglass. &ldquo;Is it my fancy, I wonder, as an observant person,
      or is he just a little&mdash;just a little taken with you, Esther? A pity
      if it is so&mdash;a great pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but her hand which rested upon the rug was trembling a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have an opportunity,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin suggested, dropping his voice,
      &ldquo;you might very delicately, you know&mdash;girls are so clever at that
      sort of thing&mdash;convey my views to Mr. Hamel as regards his leaving us and
      its effect upon your companionship. You understand me, I am sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she turned her head towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you have some particular reason for not
      wishing Mr. Hamel to leave St. David&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do my hospitable impulses full justice, dear Esther,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think that you understand me almost as well as your dear
      mother. If, by any chance, Mr. Hamel should change his mind as to taking
      up his residence at the Tower, I think you would not find me in any sense
      of the word an obdurate or exacting guardian. Come along, Mr. Hamel. That
      seat opposite to us is quite comfortable. You see, I resign myself to the
      inevitable. I have come to fetch golfers home to luncheon, and I compose
      myself to listen. Which of you will begin the epic of missed putts and
      brassey shots which failed by a foot to carry?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel sat alone upon the terrace, his afternoon coffee on a small table in
      front of him. His eyes were fixed upon a black speck at the end of the
      level roadway which led to the Tower. Only a few minutes before, Mr.
      Fentolin, in his little carriage, had shot out from the passage beneath
      the terrace, on his way to the Tower. Behind him came Meekins, bending
      over his bicycle. Hamel watched them both with thoughtful eyes. There were
      several little incidents in connection with their expedition which he
      scarcely understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came at last the sound for which he had been listening, the
      rustle of a skirt along the terraced way. Hamel turned quickly around,
      half rising to his feet, and concealing his disappointment with
      difficulty. It was Mrs. Seymour Fentolin who stood there, a little dog
      under each arm; a large hat, gay with flowers, upon her head. She wore
      patent shoes with high heels, and white silk stockings. She had, indeed,
      the air of being dressed for luncheon at a fashionable restaurant. As she
      stooped to set the dogs down, a strong waft of perfume was shaken from her
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you entirely deserted, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Miss Esther went, I think, to look for you. My host,&rdquo;
       he added, pointing to the black speck in the distance, &ldquo;begged me to defer
      my occupation of the Tower for an hour or so, and has gone down there to
      collect some of his trifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed his outstretched hand. She seemed to him to shiver for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really mean, then, that you are going to leave us?&rdquo; she asked,
      accepting the chair which he had drawn up close to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I scarcely came on a visit to St. David&rsquo;s Hall, did I?&rdquo; he reminded
      her. &ldquo;It has been delightfully hospitable of Mr. Fentolin to have insisted
      upon my staying on here for these few days, but I could not possibly
      inflict myself upon you all for an unlimited period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin sat quite still for a time. In absolute repose, if one could
      forget her mass of unnaturally golden hair, the forced and constant smile,
      the too liberal use of rouge and powder, the nervous motions of her head,
      it was easily to be realised that there were still neglected attractions
      about her face and figure. Only, in these moments of repose, an intense
      and ageing weariness seemed to have crept into her eyes and face. It was
      as though she had dropped the mask of incessant gaiety and permitted a
      glimpse of her real self to steal to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I dare say that even during these few days
      you have realised that Mr. Fentolin is a very peculiar man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have certainly observed&mdash;eccentricities,&rdquo; Hamel assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life, and the lives of my two children,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is devoted to
      the task of ministering to his happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather a heavy sacrifice?&rdquo; he asked. Mrs. Seymour Fentolin
      looked down the long, narrow way along which Mr. Fentolin had passed. He
      was out of sight now, inside the Tower. Somehow or other, the thought
      seemed to give her courage and dignity. She spoke differently, without
      nervousness or hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it may seem so. We who make it know of its
      necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head. It was not a subject for him to discuss with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin has whims,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;violent whims. We all try to
      humour him. He has his own ideas about Gerald&rsquo;s bringing up. I do not
      agree with them, but we submit. Esther, too, suffers, perhaps to a less
      extent. As for me,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke a little&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Fentolin
      likes people around him who are always cheerful. He prefers even a certain
      style&mdash;of dress. I, too, have to do my little share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel&rsquo;s face grew darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that Mr. Fentolin is a
      tyrant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are reasons,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;why I cannot discuss that with you. He
      has these strong fancies, and it is our task in life to humour them. He
      has one now with regard to the Tower, with regard to you. You are, of
      course, your own master. You can do as you choose, and you will do as you
      choose. Neither I nor my children have any claim upon your consideration.
      But, Mr. Hamel, you have been so kind that I feel moved to tell you this.
      It would make it very much easier for all of us if you would give up this
      scheme of yours, if you would stay on here instead of going to reside at
      the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel threw away his cigarette. He was deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am glad to have you speak so plainly. Let me
      answer you in the same spirit. I am leaving this house mainly because I
      have conceived certain suspicions with regard to Mr. Fentolin. I do not
      like him, I do not trust him, I do not believe in him. Therefore, I mean
      to remove myself from the burden of his hospitality. There are reasons,&rdquo;
       he went on, &ldquo;why I do not wish to leave the neighbourhood altogether.
      There are certain investigations which I wish to make. That is why I have
      decided to go to the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles was right, then!&rdquo; she cried suddenly. &ldquo;You are here to spy upon
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards her swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To spy upon him, Mrs. Fentolin? For what reason? Why? Is he a criminal,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her lips and closed them again. There was a slight frown upon
      her forehead. It was obvious that the word had unintentionally escaped
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know what it is that he called you, what he suspects you of
      being,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin is very clever, and he is generally
      at work upon something. We do not enquire into the purpose of his labours.
      The only thing I know is that he suspects you of wanting to steal one of
      his secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secrets? But what secrets has he?&rdquo; Hamel demanded. &ldquo;Is he an inventor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me idle questions,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;We have gone, perhaps, a little
      further than I intended. I came to plead with you for all our sakes, if I
      could, to make things more comfortable by remaining here instead of
      insisting upon your claim to the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; Hamel said firmly. &ldquo;I like to do what I can to please and
      benefit my friends, especially those who have been kind to me. I will be
      quite frank with you. There is nothing you could ask me which I would not
      do for your daughter&rsquo;s sake&mdash;if I were convinced that it was for her
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Seymour Fentolin seemed to be trembling a little. Her hands were
      crossed upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known her for so short a time,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel smiled confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not weary you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with the usual trite remarks. I will
      simply tell you that the time has been long enough. I love your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin sat quite still. Only in her eyes, fixed steadily seawards,
      there was the light of something new, as though some new thought was
      stirring in her brain. Her lips moved, although the sound which came was
      almost inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she murmured, as though arguing with some unseen critic of her
      thoughts. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a rich man,&rdquo; Hamel went on, &ldquo;but I am fairly well off. I could
      afford to be married at once, and I should like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned suddenly upon him and gripped his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;you are a traveller, are you not? You have
      been to distant countries, where white people go seldom; inaccessible
      countries, where even the arm of the law seldom reaches. Couldn&rsquo;t you take
      her away there, take her right away, travel so fast that nothing could
      catch you, and hide&mdash;hide for a little time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel stared at his companion, for a moment, blankly. Her attitude was so
      unexpected, her questioning so fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; he began&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly relaxed her grip of his arm. Something of the old
      hopelessness was settling down upon her face. Her hands fell into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;I forgot! I mustn&rsquo;t talk like that. She, too, is
      part of the sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of the sacrifice,&rdquo; Hamel repeated, frowning. &ldquo;Is she, indeed! I
      don&rsquo;t know what sacrifice you mean, but Esther is the girl whom sooner or
      later, somehow or other, I am going to make my wife, and when she is my
      wife, I shall see to it that she isn&rsquo;t afraid of Miles Fentolin or of any
      other man breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of hopefulness shone through the stony misery of the woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Esther care?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell? I can only hope so. If she doesn&rsquo;t yet, she shall some
      day. I suppose,&rdquo; he added, with a sigh, &ldquo;it is rather too soon yet to
      expect that she should. If it is necessary, I can wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin&rsquo;s eyes were once more fixed upon the Tower. The sun had
      caught the top of the telephone wire and played around it till it seemed
      like a long, thin shaft of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go down there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Esther will not be allowed to see you
      at all. Mr. Fentolin has decided to take it as a personal affront. You
      will be ostracised from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t be for long, at any rate. And as
      to not seeing Esther, you must remember that I come from outside this
      little domain, and I see nothing more in Mr. Fentolin than a bad-tempered,
      mischievous, tyrannical old invalid, who is fortunately prevented by his
      infirmities from doing as much mischief as he might. I am not afraid of
      your brother-in-law, or of the bully he takes about with him, and I am
      going to see your daughter somehow or other, and I am going to marry her
      before very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thrust out her hand suddenly and grasped his. The fingers were very
      thin, almost bony, and covered with rings. Their grip was feverish and he
      felt them tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brave man, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she declared speaking in a low, quick
      undertone. &ldquo;Perhaps you are right. The shadow isn&rsquo;t over your head. You
      haven&rsquo;t lived in the terror of it. You may find a way. God grant it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrung his fingers and rose to her feet. Her voice suddenly changed
      into another key. Hamel knew instinctively that she wished him to
      understand that their conversation was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chow-Chow,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;come along, dear, we must have our walk. Come
      along, Koto; come along, little dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel strolled down the terrace steps and wandered for a time in the
      gardens behind the house. Here, in the shelter of the great building, he
      found himself suddenly in an atmosphere of springtime. There were beds of
      crocuses and hyacinths, fragrant clumps of violets, borders of snowdrops,
      masses of primroses and early anemones. He slowly climbed one or two steep
      paths until he reached a sort of plateau, level with the top of the house.
      The flowers here grew more sparsely, the track of the salt wind lay like a
      withering band across the flower-beds. The garden below was like a little
      oasis of colour and perfume. Arrived at the bordering red brick wall, he
      turned around and looked along the narrow road which led to the sea. There
      was no sign of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s return. Then to his left he saw a gate open
      and heard the clamour of dogs. Esther appeared, walking swiftly towards
      the little stretch of road which led to the village. He hurried after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsociable person!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he caught her up. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know
      that I was longing for a walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I read your thoughts?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Besides, a few minutes
      ago I saw you on the terrace, talking to mother. I am only going as far as
      the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have business there myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are nine cottages, three farmhouses, and a general shop in St.
      David&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Also about fifteen fishermen&rsquo;s cottages dotted
      about the marsh. Your business, I presume, is with the general shop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, falling into step with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;is to find a woman to come in and look after
      me at the Tower. Your servant who valets me has given me two names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something of the lightness faded from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have quite made up your mind to leave us?&rdquo; she asked slowly.
      &ldquo;Mother wasn&rsquo;t able to persuade you to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very kind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there are really grave reasons why I
      feel that I must not accept Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s hospitality any longer. I had,&rdquo;
       he went on, &ldquo;a very interesting talk with your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned quickly towards him. The slightest possible tinge of additional
      colour was in her cheeks. She was walking on the top of a green bank, with
      the wind blowing her skirts around her. The turn of her head was a little
      diffident, almost shy. Her eyes were asking him questions. At that moment
      she seemed to him, with her slim body, her gently parted lips and soft,
      tremulous eyes, almost like a child. He drew a little nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told your mother,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;all that I have told you, and more. I
      told her, dear, that I cared for you, that I wanted you to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was caught in a little gust of wind. Both her hands went up to her
      hat; her face was hidden. She stepped down from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;It was the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped forward, intent upon looking into her face. The mystic softness
      was still in her eyes, but her general expression was inscrutable. It
      seemed to him that there was fear there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did mother say?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing discouraging,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she minded at all. I
      have decided, if you give me permission, to go and talk to Mr. Fentolin
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head very emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t give him another whip to lash us
      with. Keep silent. Let me just have the memory for a few days all to
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words came to him like numb things. There was little expression in
      them, and yet he felt that somehow they meant so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Esther dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall do just as you ask me. At the same time,
      please listen. I think that you are all absurdly frightened of Mr.
      Fentolin. Living here alone with him, you have all grown under his
      dominance to an unreasonable extent. Because of his horrible infirmity,
      you have let yourselves become his slaves. There are limits to this sort
      of thing, Esther. I come here as a stranger, and I see nothing more in Mr.
      Fentolin than a very selfish, irritable, domineering, and capricious old
      man. Humour him, by all means. I am willing to do the same myself. But
      when it comes to the great things in life, neither he nor any living
      person is going to keep from me the woman I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked by his side in silence. Her breath was coming a little quicker,
      her fingers lay passive in his. Then for a moment he felt the grip of them
      almost burn into his flesh. Still she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your permission, dear,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to go to him. I suppose he
      calls himself your guardian. If he says no, you are of age. I just want
      you to believe that I am strong enough to put my arms around you and to
      carry you away to my own world and keep you there, although an army of Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s creatures followed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and he saw the great transformation. Her face was brilliant,
      her eyes shone with wonderful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;will you say or do nothing at all for a little
      time, until I tell you when? I want just a few days&rsquo; peace. You have said
      such beautiful things to me that I want them to lie there in my thoughts,
      in my heart, undisturbed, for just a little time. You see, we are at the
      village now. I am going to call at this third cottage. While I am inside,
      you can go and make what enquiries you like. Come and knock at the door
      for me when you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will walk back together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will walk back together,&rdquo; she promised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take you home another way. I will take you over what they call the
      Common, and come down behind the Hall into the gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dismissed him with a little smile. He strolled along the village
      street and plunged into the mysterious recesses of the one tiny shop.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel met Kinsley shortly before one o&rsquo;clock the following afternoon, in
      the lounge of the Royal Hotel at Norwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got my wire, then?&rdquo; the latter asked, as he held out his hand. &ldquo;I had
      it sent by special messenger from Wells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It arrived directly after breakfast,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the
      easiest matter to get here, even then, for there are only about two trains
      a day, and I didn&rsquo;t want to borrow a car from Mr. Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; Kinsley agreed. &ldquo;I wanted you to come absolutely on your
      own. Let&rsquo;s get into the coffee-room and have some lunch now. I want to
      catch the afternoon train back to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you&rsquo;ve come all the way down here to talk to me
      for half an hour or so?&rdquo; Hamel demanded, as they took their places at a
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the way from town,&rdquo; Kinsley assented, &ldquo;and up to the eyes in work we
      are, too. Dick, what do you think of Miles Fentolin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I know!&rdquo; Hamel answered, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing definite to tell us, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Mr. John P. Dunster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left yesterday morning,&rdquo; Hamel said. &ldquo;I saw him go. He looked very
      shaky. I understood that Mr. Fentolin sent him to Yarmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Fentolin know that there was an enquiry on foot about this man&rsquo;s
      disappearance?&rdquo; Kinsley asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I heard Lord Saxthorpe tell him that the police had received
      orders to scour the country for him, and that they were coming to St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley, for a moment, was singularly and eloquently profane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Mr. Fentolin let him go, then. If Saxthorpe had only held his
      tongue, or if those infernal police hadn&rsquo;t got chattering with the
      magistrates, we might have made a coup. As it is, the game&rsquo;s up. Mr.
      Dunster left for Yarmouth, you say, yesterday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him go myself. He looked very shaky and ill, but he was able to
      smoke a big cigar and walk down-stairs leaning on the doctor&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt,&rdquo; Kinsley remarked, &ldquo;but that you saw what you say you saw.
      At the same time, you may be surprised to hear that Mr. Dunster has
      disappeared again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappeared again?&rdquo; Hamel muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks very much,&rdquo; Kinsley continued, &ldquo;as though your friend Miles
      Fentolin has been playing with him like a cat with a mouse. He has been
      obliged to turn him out of one hiding-place, and he has simply transferred
      him to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunster left quite alone in the car,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He was on his guard
      too, for Mr. Fentolin and he had had words. I really can&rsquo;t see how it was
      possible for him to have got into any more trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo; Kinsley demanded. &ldquo;Come, I will let you a little
      further into our confidence. We have reason to believe that he carries
      with him a written message which is practically the only chance we have of
      avoiding disaster during the next few days. That written message is
      addressed to the delegates at The Hague, who are now sitting. Nothing had
      been heard of Dunster or the document he carries. No word has come from
      him of any sort since he left St. David&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you tried to trace him from there?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trace him?&rdquo; Kinsley repeated. &ldquo;By heavens, you don&rsquo;t seem to understand,
      Dick, the immense, the extraordinary importance of this man to us! The
      cleverest detective in England spent yesterday under your nose at St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall. There are a dozen others working upon the job as hard as
      they can. All the reports confirm what you say&mdash;that Dunster left St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall at half-past nine yesterday morning, and he certainly arrived
      in Yarmouth at a little before twelve. From there he seems, however, to
      have completely disappeared. The car went back to St. David&rsquo;s Hall empty;
      the man only stayed long enough in Yarmouth, in fact, to have his dinner.
      We cannot find a single smack owner who was approached in any way for the
      hire of a boat. Yarmouth has been ransacked in vain. He certainly has not
      arrived at The Hague or we should have heard news at once. As a last
      resource, I ran down here to see you on the chance of your having picked
      up any information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know a good deal more than I do, already,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Mr. Fentolin? You have stayed in his house. You have
      had an opportunity of studying him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as my impressions go,&rdquo; Hamel replied, &ldquo;everything which you have
      suggested might very well be true. I think that either out of sheer love of
      mischief, or from some subtler motive, he is capable of anything. Every
      one in the place, except one poor woman, seems to look upon him as a sort
      of supernatural being. He gives money away to worthless people with both
      hands. Yet I share your opinion of him. I believe that he is a creature
      without conscience or morals. I have sat at his table and shivered when he
      has smiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you staying at St. David&rsquo;s Hall now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you now, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at St. David&rsquo;s Tower&mdash;the little place I told you of that
      belonged to my father&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know whether I shall be able to
      stop there. Mr. Fentolin, for some reason or other, very much resented my
      leaving the Hall and was very annoyed at my insisting upon claiming the
      Tower. When I went down to the village to get some one to come up and look
      after me, there wasn&rsquo;t a woman there who would come. It didn&rsquo;t matter what
      I offered, they were all the same. They all muttered some excuse or other,
      and seemed only anxious to show me out. At the village shop they seemed to
      hate to serve me with anything. It was all I could do to get a packet of
      tobacco yesterday afternoon. You would really think that I was the most
      unpopular person who ever lived, and it can only be because of Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin evidently doesn&rsquo;t like to have you in the locality,&rdquo; Kinsley
      remarked thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was all right so long as I was at St. David&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; Hamel observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this little place like&mdash;St. David&rsquo;s Tower, you call it?&rdquo;
       Kinsley asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little stone building actually on the beach,&rdquo; Hamel explained.
      &ldquo;There is a large shed which Mr. Fentolin keeps locked up, and the
      habitable portion consists just of a bedroom and sitting-room. From what I
      can see, Mr. Fentolin has been making a sort of hobby of the place. There
      is telephonic communication with the house, and he seems to have used the
      sitting-room as a sort of studio. He paints sea pictures and really paints
      them very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man came into the coffee-room, made some enquiry of the waiter and went
      out again. Hamel stared at him in a puzzled manner. For the moment he
      could only remember that the face was familiar. Then he suddenly gave vent
      to a little exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one would think that I had been followed,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The man who
      has just looked into the room is one of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s parasites or
      bodyguards, or whatever you call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably have,&rdquo; Kinsley agreed. &ldquo;What post does he hold in the
      household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;I saw him the first day I arrived and
      not since. Sort of secretary, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a queer-looking fellow, anyway,&rdquo; Kinsley muttered. &ldquo;Look out, Dick.
      Here he comes back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ryan approached the table a little diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will forgive the liberty, sir,&rdquo; he said to Hamel. &ldquo;You
      remember me, I trust&mdash;Mr. Ryan. I am the librarian at St. David&rsquo;s
      Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d seen you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; the man continued, &ldquo;whether you had a car of Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s in Norwich to-day, and if so, whether I might beg a seat back
      in case you were returning before the five o&rsquo;clock train? I came in early
      this morning to go through some manuscripts at a second-hand bookseller&rsquo;s
      here, and I have unfortunately missed the train back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in by train myself, or I would have given you a lift back, with
      pleasure,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ryan expressed his thanks briefly and left the room. Kinsley watched
      him from over the top of a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is one of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s creatures, too,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Keeping
      his eye on you in Norwich, eh? Tell me, Dick, by-the-by, how do you get on
      with the rest of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s household, and exactly of whom does it
      consist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is his sister-in-law,&rdquo; Hamel replied, &ldquo;Mrs. Seymour Fentolin. She
      is a strange, tired-looking woman who seems to stand in mortal fear of Mr.
      Fentolin. She is always overdressed and never natural, but it seems to me
      that nearly everything she does is done to suit his whims, or at his
      instigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Seymour Fentolin,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a really fine fellow he was.
      Well, who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the nephew and niece. The boy is half sullen, half discontented, yet
      he, too, seems to obey his uncle blindly. The three of them seem to be his
      slaves. It&rsquo;s a thing you can&rsquo;t live in the house without noticing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be a cheerful sort of household,&rdquo; Kinsley observed. &ldquo;You read
      the papers, I suppose, Dick?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On and off, the last few days. I seem to have been busy doing all sorts
      of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you something,&rdquo; Kinsley continued. &ldquo;The whole of our
      available fleet is engaged in carrying out what they call a demonstration
      in the North Sea. They have patrol boats out in every direction, and only
      the short distance wireless signals are being used. Everything, of course,
      is in code, yet we know this for a fact: a good deal of private
      information passing between the Admiral and his commanders was known in
      Germany three hours after the signals themselves had been given. It is
      suspected&mdash;more than suspected, in fact&mdash;that these messages
      were picked up by Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s wireless installation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he could help receiving them,&rdquo; Hamel remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could help decoding them and sending them through to Germany, though,&rdquo;
       Kinsley retorted grimly. &ldquo;The worst of it is, he has a private telephone
      wire in his house to London. If he isn&rsquo;t up to mischief, what does he need
      all these things for&mdash;private telegraph line, private telephone,
      private wireless? We have given the postmaster a hint to have the
      telegraph office moved down into the village, but I don&rsquo;t know that that
      will help us much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as regards the wireless,&rdquo; Hamel said, &ldquo;I rather believe that it is
      temporarily dismantled. We had a sailor-man over, the morning before
      yesterday, to complain of his messages having been picked up. Mr. Fentolin
      promised at once to put his installation out of work for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done plenty of mischief with it already,&rdquo; Kinsley groaned.
      &ldquo;However, it was Dunster I came down to make enquiries about. I couldn&rsquo;t
      help hoping that you might have been able to put us on the right track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing beyond what I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he look when he went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very ill indeed,&rdquo; Hamel declared. &ldquo;I afterwards saw the nurse who had
      been attending him, and she admitted that he was not fit to travel. I
      should say the probabilities are that he is laid up again somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you actually speak to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a word or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw him go off in the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerald Fentolin and I both saw him and wished him good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley glanced at the clock and rose to his feet. &ldquo;Walk down to the
      station with me,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you, I am sure,&rdquo; he went
      on, as they left the hotel a few minutes later, &ldquo;that if anything does
      turn up, or if you get the glimmering of an idea, you&rsquo;ll let me know?
      We&rsquo;ve a small army looking for the fellow, but it does seem as though he
      had disappeared off the face of the earth. If he doesn&rsquo;t turn up before
      the end of the Conference, we are done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Hamel asked, after they had walked for some distance in
      silence, &ldquo;exactly why is our fleet demonstrating to such an extent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Conference I have spoken of,&rdquo; Kinsley replied, &ldquo;which is being held
      at The Hague, is being held, we know, purposely to discuss certain matters
      in which we are interested. It is meeting for their discussion without any
      invitation having been sent to this country. There is only one reply
      possible to such a course. It is there in the North Sea. But unfortunately&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kinsley paused. His tone and his expression had alike become gloomier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Hamel begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our reply, after all, is a miserable affair,&rdquo; Kinsley concluded. &ldquo;You
      remember the outcry over the withdrawal of our Mediterranean Fleet? Now
      you see its sequel. We haven&rsquo;t a ship worth a snap of the fingers from
      Gibraltar to Suez. If France deserts us, it&rsquo;s good-by to Malta, good-by to
      Egypt, good-by to India. It&rsquo;s the disruption of the British Empire. And
      all this,&rdquo; he wound up, as he paused before taking his seat in the railway
      carriage, &ldquo;all this might even now be avoided if only we could lay our
      hands upon the message which that man Dunster was bringing from New York!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once more Hamel descended from the little train, and, turning away from
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall, made his way across the marshes, seawards. The sunshine
      of the last few days had departed. The twilight was made gloomy by a
      floating veil of white mist, which hung about in wet patches. Hamel turned
      up his coat collar as he walked and shivered a little. The thought of his
      solitary night and uncomfortable surroundings, after all the luxury of St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall, was scarcely inspiring. Yet, on the whole, he was splendidly
      cheerful. The glamour of a host of new sensations was upon him. There was
      a new love of living in his heart. He forgot the cold east wind which blew
      in his face, bringing with it little puffs of damp grey mist. He forgot
      the cheerlessness which he was about to face, the lonely night before him.
      For the first time in his life a woman reigned in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he actually reached the very side of the Tower that he
      came back to earth. As he opened the door, he found a surprise in store
      for him. A fire was burning in the sitting-room, smoke was ascending from
      the kitchen chimney. The little round table was laid with a white cloth.
      There was a faint odour of cooking from the back premises. His lamp was
      lit, there were logs hissing and crackling upon the fire. As he stood
      there looking wonderingly about him, the door from the back was opened.
      Hannah Cox came quietly into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time would you like your dinner, sir?&rdquo; she enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, are you going to keep house for me, Mrs. Cox?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir. I heard that you had been in the village, looking for
      some one. I am sorry that I was away. There is no one else who would come
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I discovered,&rdquo; he remarked, a little grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;would come to you because of Mr. Fentolin. He
      does not wish to have you here. They love him so much in the village that
      he had only to breathe the word. It was enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you are here,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not count,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am outside all these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel gave a little sigh of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad you could come, anyhow. If you have something for dinner,
      I should like it in about half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the narrow stairs which led to his bedroom. To his surprise,
      there were many things there for his comfort which he had forgotten to
      order&mdash;clean bed-linen, towels, even a curtain upon the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get all the linen up-stairs from, Mrs. Cox?&rdquo; he asked her,
      when he descended. &ldquo;The room was almost empty yesterday, and I forgot
      nearly all the things I meant to bring home from Norwich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Seymour Fentolin sent down a hamper for you,&rdquo; the woman replied,
      &ldquo;with a message from Mr. Fentolin. He said that nothing among the oddments
      left by your father had been preserved, but that you were welcome to
      anything you desired, if you would let them know at the Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of both of them,&rdquo; Hamel said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stood still for a moment, looking at him. Then she drew a step
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Fentolin given you the key of the shed?&rdquo; she asked, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need the place, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not give you the key?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin said that he had some things in there which he wished to
      keep locked up,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained thoughtful for several moments. Then she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was not likely he would not give you that key!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel dined simply but comfortably. Mrs. Cox cleared away the things,
      brought him his coffee, and appeared a few minutes later, her shawl
      wrapped around her, ready for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be here at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, sir,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel was a little startled. He withdrew the pip from his mouth and looked
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten. There is no place for you
      to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go back to my brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel put some money upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please get anything that is necessary,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I shall leave you
      to do the housekeeping for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be staying here long, sir?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you will stay for very long. I shall
      get only the things that you require from day to day. Good night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room. Hamel looked after her for a moment with a frown. In
      some indescribable way, the woman half impressed, half irritated him. She
      had always the air of keeping something in the background. He followed her
      out on to the little ridge of beach, a few minutes after she had left. The
      mist was still drifting about. Only a few yards away the sea rolled in,
      filling the air with dull thunder. The marshland was half obscured. St.
      David&rsquo;s Hall was invisible, but like strangely-hung lanterns in an empty
      space he saw the line of lights from the great house gleam through the
      obscurity. There was no sound save the sound of the sea. He shivered
      slightly. It was like an empty land, this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, moved by some instinct of curiosity, he made his way round to the
      closed door of the boat-house, only to find it, as he had expected,
      locked. He shook it slightly, without result. Then he strolled round to
      the back, entered his own little abode by the kitchen, and tried the other
      door which led into the boat-house. It was not only locked, but a staple
      had been put in, and it was fastened with a padlock of curious design
      which he did not remember to have seen there before. Again, half
      unconsciously, he listened, and again he found the silence oppressive. He
      went back to his room, brought out some of the books which it had been his
      intention to study, and sat and read over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock he went to bed. As he threw open his window before
      undressing, it seemed to him that he could catch the sound of voices from
      the sea. He listened intently. A grey pall hung everywhere. To the left,
      with strange indistinctness, almost like something human struggling to
      assert itself, came the fitful flash from the light at the entrance to the
      tidal way. Once more he strained his ears. This time there was no doubt
      about it. He heard the sound of fishermen&rsquo;s voices. He heard one of them
      say distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard aport, Dave lad! That&rsquo;s Fentolin&rsquo;s light. Keep her out a bit.
      Steady, lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through a rift in the mist, he caught a glimpse of the brown sail of a
      fishing-boat, dangerously near the land. He watched it alter its course
      slightly and pass on. Then again there was silence. He undressed slowly
      and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he woke with a start and sat up in bed, listening intently,
      listening for he knew not what. Except for the backward scream of the
      pebbles, dragged down every few seconds by the receding waves, an unbroken
      silence seemed to prevail. He struck a match and looked at his watch. It
      was exactly three o&rsquo;clock. He got out of bed. He was a man in perfect
      health, ignorant of the meaning of nerves, a man of proved courage. Yet he
      was conscious that his pulses were beating with absurd rapidity. A new
      feeling seemed to possess him. He could almost have declared that he was
      afraid. What sound had awakened him? He had no idea, yet he seemed to have
      a distinct and absolute conviction that it had been a real sound and no
      dream. He drew aside the curtains and looked out of the window. The mist
      now seemed to have become almost a fog, to have closed in upon sea and
      land. There was nothing whatever to be seen. As he stood there for a
      moment, listening, his face became moist with the drifting vapour.
      Suddenly upon the beach he saw what at first he imagined must be an
      optical illusion&mdash;a long shaft of light, invisible in itself except
      that it seemed to slightly change the density of the mist. He threw on an
      overcoat over his pyjamas, thrust on his slippers, and taking up his own
      electric torch, hastily descended the stairs. He opened the front door and
      stepped out on to the beach. He stood in the very place where the light
      had seemed to be, and looked inland. There was no sign of any human
      person, not a sound except the falling of the sea upon the pebbly beach.
      He raised his voice and called out. Somehow or other, speech seemed to be
      a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. He tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is any one there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer. He watched the veiled light from the harbour appear and
      disappear. It threw no shadow of illumination upon the spot to which he
      had gazed from his window. One window at St. David&rsquo;s Hall was illuminated.
      The rest of the place was wrapped now in darkness. He walked up to the
      boat-house. The door was still locked. There was no sign that any one had
      been there. Reluctantly at last he re-entered the Tower and made his way
      up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound that fellow Kinsley!&rdquo; he muttered, as he threw off his overcoat.
      &ldquo;All his silly suggestions and melodramatic ideas have given me a fit of
      nerves. I am going to bed, and I am going to sleep. That couldn&rsquo;t have
      been a light I saw at all. I couldn&rsquo;t have heard anything. I am going to
      sleep.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel awoke to find his room filled with sunshine and a soft wind blowing
      in through the open window. There was a pleasant odour of coffee floating
      up from the kitchen. He looked at his watch&mdash;it was past eight
      o&rsquo;clock. The sea was glittering and bespangled with sunlight. He found
      among his scanty belongings a bathing suit, and, wrapped in his overcoat,
      hurried down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast in half an hour, Mrs. Cox,&rdquo; he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the door, watching him as he stepped across the pebbles and
      plunged in. For a few moments he swam. Then he turned over on his back.
      The sunlight was gleaming from every window of St. David&rsquo;s Hall. He even
      fancied that upon the terrace he could see a white-clad figure looking
      towards him. He turned over and swam once more. From her place in the
      doorway Mrs. Cox called out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind the Dagger Rocks, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand. The splendid exhilaration of the salt water seemed to
      give him unlimited courage. He dived, but the woman&rsquo;s cry of fear soon
      recalled him. Presently he swam to shore and hurried up the beach. Mrs.
      Cox, with a sigh of relief, disappeared into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those rocks on your nerves again, Mrs. Cox?&rdquo; he asked, good-humouredly,
      as he took his place at the breakfast table a quarter of an hour later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only us who live here, sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;who know how terrible
      they are. There&rsquo;s one&mdash;it comes up like my hand&mdash;a long spike. A
      boat once struck upon that, and it&rsquo;s as though it&rsquo;d been sawn through the
      middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have a look at them some day,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I am going to work
      this morning, Mrs. Cox. Lunch at one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took rugs and established himself with a pile of books at the back of a
      grassy knoll, sheltered from the wind, with the sea almost at his feet. He
      sharpened his pencil and numbered the page of his notebook. Then he looked
      up towards the Hall garden and found himself dreaming. The sunshine was
      delicious, and a gentle optimism seemed to steal over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a fool!&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;I am catching some part of these
      people&rsquo;s folly. Mr. Fentolin is only an ordinary, crotchety invalid with
      queer tastes. On the big things he is probably like other men. I shall go
      to him this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sea-gull screamed over his head. Little, brown sailed fishing-boats came
      gliding down the harbourway. A pleasant, sensuous joyfulness seemed part
      of the spirit of the day. Hamel stretched himself out upon the dry sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work be hanged!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft voice answered him almost in his ear, a voice which was becoming
      very familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most admirable sentiment, my young friend, which you seem to be doing
      your best to live up to. Not a line written, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat up upon his rug. Mr. Fentolin, in his little carriage, was there by
      his side. Behind was the faithful Meekins, with an easel under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust that your first night in your new abode has been a pleasant one?&rdquo;
       Mr. Fentolin asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slept quite well, thanks,&rdquo; Hamel replied. &ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re going to
      paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, alas!&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;one of my weaknesses. I can work only in
      solitude. I came down on the chance that the fine weather might have
      tempted you over to the Golf Club. As it is, I shall return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am awfully sorry,&rdquo; Hamel said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go out of sight somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not ask your pardon for my absurd humours,&rdquo; he continued, a little
      sadly. &ldquo;Their existence, however, I cannot deny. I will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a pity for you to do that,&rdquo; Hamel remarked. &ldquo;You see, I might
      stay here for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face darkened. He looked at the young man with a sort of
      pensive wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; the latter went on, &ldquo;you say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to something I am going to ask
      you, I might even stay&mdash;in the neighbourhood&mdash;for longer still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sat quite motionless in his chair; his eyes were fixed upon
      Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you are going to ask me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to marry your niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin looked at the young man in mild surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden decision on your part, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Hamel assured him. &ldquo;I have been ten years looking for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the young lady?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin enquired. &ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir,&rdquo; Hamel replied, &ldquo;that she would be willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is forced sometimes,&rdquo; he remarked regretfully, &ldquo;to realise the
      selfishness of our young people. For many years one devotes oneself to
      providing them with all the comforts and luxuries of life. Then, in a
      single day, they turn around and give everything they have to give to a
      stranger. So you want to marry Esther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a very moderate fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She need have none at all,&rdquo; Hamel replied; &ldquo;I have enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glanced towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you had better go and tell her so; in which
      case, I shall be able to paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have your permission, then?&rdquo; Hamel asked, rising to his feet eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Negatively,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin agreed, &ldquo;you have. I cannot refuse. Esther is
      of age; the thing is reasonable. I do not know whether she will be happy
      with you or not. A young man of your disposition who declines to study the
      whims of an unfortunate creature like myself is scarcely likely to be
      possessed of much sensibility. However, perhaps your views as to a
      solitary residence here will change with your engagement to my niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel did not reply for a moment. He was trying to ask himself why, even
      in the midst of this rush of anticipatory happiness, he should be
      conscious of a certain reluctance to leave the Tower&mdash;and Mr.
      Fentolin. He was looking longingly towards the Hall. Mr. Fentolin waved
      him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and make love,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and leave me alone. We are both in
      pursuit of beauty&mdash;only our methods differ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel hesitated no longer but walked up the narrow path with swift,
      buoyant footsteps. Everywhere he seemed to be surrounded by the glorious
      spring sunshine. It glittered in the little pools and creeks by his side.
      It drew a new colour from the dun-coloured marshes, the masses of emerald
      seaweed, the shimmering sands. It flashed in the long row of windows of
      the Hall. As he drew nearer, he could see the banks of yellow crocuses in
      the sloping gardens behind. There were odours of spring in the air. He ran
      lightly up the terrace steps. There was an easy-chair drawn into her
      favourite corner, and a book upon the table, but no sign of Esther. He
      hesitated for a moment, and then, retracing his steps along the terrace,
      entered the house by the front door, which stood wide open. There was no
      one in the hall, scarcely a sound about the place. A great clock ticked
      solemnly from the foot of the stairs. There was not even a servant in
      sight. Hamel wandered around, at a loss what to do. He opened the door of
      the drawing-room and looked in. It was empty. He turned away, meaning to
      ring a bell. On his way across the hall he paused. A curiously suggestive
      sound reached him faintly from the end of one of the passages. It was the
      click of a typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamel stood for a moment perfectly still. He had hurried up to the Hall,
      filled with the one selfish joy common to all mankind. He had had no
      thought save the thought of seeing Esther. The click of that machine
      brought him back to the stern realities of life. He remembered his talk to
      Kinsley, his promise. On the hall table he could see from where he was
      standing the great headlines which announced the nation&rsquo;s anxiety. He was
      in the house of a suspected spy. The click of the typewriter was an
      accompaniment to his thought. He looked around once more and listened.
      Then he made his way quietly across the hall and down the long passage, at
      the end of which the room which Mr. Fentolin called his workroom was
      situated. He turned the handle of the door and entered, closing it
      immediately behind him. The woman who was typing paused with her fingers
      upon the keys. Her eyes met his coldly, without curiosity. She had paused
      in her work, but she took no other notice of his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Fentolin sent you here?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came over to the typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin has not sent me,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I am here on my own
      account. I dare say you will think that I am a lunatic to come to you like
      this. Nevertheless, please listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers left the keys. She laid her hands upon the table in front of
      her. He drew a little nearer. She covered over the sheets of paper with
      which she was surrounded with a pad of blotting-paper. He pointed suddenly
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What is there in your work that you
      are afraid I might see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered him without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are private papers of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s. No one has any business to
      see them. No one has any business to enter this room. Why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to the Hall to find Miss Fentolin,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I heard the click
      of your typewriter. I came to you, I suppose I should say, on impulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested upon his, filled with a cold and questioning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an impression up in London,&rdquo; Hamel went on, &ldquo;that Mr. Fentolin
      has been interfering by means of his wireless in affairs which don&rsquo;t
      concern him, and giving away valuable information. This man Dunster&rsquo;s
      disappearance is as yet unexplained. I feel myself justified in making
      certain investigations, and among the first of them I should like you to
      tell me exactly the nature of the work for which Mr. Fentolin finds a
      secretary necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced towards the bell. He moved to the edge of the table as though
      to intercept her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any ordinary case,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I would not ask you to betray your
      employer&rsquo;s confidence. As things are, I think I am justified. You are
      English, are you not? You realise, I suppose, that the country is on the
      brink of war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him from the depths of her still, lusterless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be a very foolish person,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;if you expect to
      obtain information in this manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but my folly has brought me to you, and you
      can give me the information if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Fentolin?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at the Tower,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I left him there. He sent me up to see
      Miss Fentolin. I was looking for her when the click of your typewriter
      reminded me of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned composedly back to her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you had better go and find Miss Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense! You can&rsquo;t think I have risked giving myself away to
      you for nothing? I mean to search this room, to read the papers which you
      are typing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced around her a little contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;Pray proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged the glances of duelists. Her plain black frock was buttoned
      up to her throat. Her colourless face seemed set in exact and
      expressionless lines. Her eyes were like windows of glass. He felt only
      their scrutiny; nothing of the reason for it, or of the thoughts which
      stirred behind in her brain. There was nothing about her attitude which
      seemed in any way threatening, yet he had the feeling that in this
      interview it was she who possessed the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a foolish person,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You are so foolish that you
      are not, in all probability, in the slightest degree dangerous. Believe
      me, ours is an unequal duel. There is a bell upon this table which has
      apparently escaped your notice. I sit with my finger upon the button&mdash;so.
      I have only to press it, and the servants will be here. I do not wish to
      press it. I do not desire that you should be, as you certainly would be,
      banished from this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was immensely puzzled. She had not resented his strange intrusion. She
      had accepted it, indeed, with curious equanimity. Her forefinger lingered
      still over the little ivory knob of the bell attached to her desk. He
      shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the advantage of me,&rdquo; he admitted, a little curtly. &ldquo;All the
      same, I think I could possess myself of those sheets of paper, you know,
      before the bell was answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be wise, I wonder, then, to ensure their safety?&rdquo; she asked
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her finger pressed the bell. He took a quick step forward. She held out
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;These sheets will tell you nothing which you do not
      know already unless you are a fool. Never mind the bell. That is my
      affair. I am sending you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned a little towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to bribe you, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you haven&rsquo;t tried that before. No, it would not&mdash;not with
      money, that is to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Fentolin, I presume?&rdquo; he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to tell him,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Nothing has happened.
      Richards,&rdquo; she went on, as a servant entered the room, &ldquo;Mr. Hamel is
      looking for Miss Fentolin. Will you see if you can find her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s expression was full of polite regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fentolin went over to Legh Woods early this morning, sir,&rdquo; he
      announced. &ldquo;She is staying to lunch with Lady Saxthorpe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel stood quite still for a moment. Then he turned to the window. In the
      far distance he could catch a glimpse of the Tower. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s chair
      had disappeared from the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must have made a mistake. I will hurry back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were more questions which he was longing to ask, but the cold
      negativeness of her manner chilled him. She sat with her fingers poised
      over the keys, waiting for his departure. He turned and left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, his carriage drawn up close to the beach, was painting
      steadily when Hamel stood once more by his side. His eyes moved only from
      the sea to the canvas. He never turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your wooing has not prospered, my young friend,&rdquo; he remarked gently.
      &ldquo;I am sorry. Is there anything I can do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your niece has gone out to lunch,&rdquo; Hamel replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin stopped painting. His face was full of concern as he looked
      up at Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how can I apologise! Of course she has gone
      out to lunch. She has gone out to Lady Saxthorpe&rsquo;s. I remember the subject
      being discussed. I myself, in fact, was the instigator of her going. I owe
      you a thousand apologies, Mr. Hamel. Let me make what amends are possible
      for your useless journey. Dine with us to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor amends,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued. &ldquo;A morning like this was made for
      lovers. Sunshine and blue sky, a salt breeze flavoured just a little with
      that lavender, and a stroll through my spring gardens, where my hyacinths
      are like a field of purple and gold, a mantle of jewels upon the brown
      earth. Ah, well! One&rsquo;s thoughts will wander to the beautiful things of
      life. There were once women who loved me, Mr. Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked doubtfully at the strange little figure in the chair. Was
      this genuine, he wondered, a voluntary outburst, or was it some subtle
      attempt to incite sympathy? Mr. Fentolin seemed almost to have read his
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for the sake of your pity that I say this,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Mine
      is only the passing across the line which age as well as infirmity makes
      inevitable. No one in the world who lives to grow old, and who has loved
      and felt the fire of it in his veins, can pass that line without sorrow,
      or look back without a pang. I am among a great army. Well, well, I shall
      paint no more to-day,&rdquo; he concluded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your servant?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glanced around him carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has wandered away out of sight. He knows well how necessary solitude
      is to me if once I take the brush between my fingers&mdash;solitude
      natural and entire, I mean. If any one is within a dozen yards of me I
      know it, even though I cannot see them. Meekins is wandering somewhere the
      other side of the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin begged. &ldquo;Presently he will appear, in plenty
      of time. There is the morning to be passed&mdash;barely eleven o&rsquo;clock, I
      think, now. I shall sit in my chair, and sink a little down, and dream of
      these beautiful lights, these rolling, foam-flecked waves, these patches
      of blue and shifting green. I can form them in my brain. I can make a
      picture there, even though my fingers refuse to move. You are not an
      aesthete, I think, Mr. Hamel? The study of beauty does not mean to you
      what it did to your father, and my father, and, in a smaller way to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Hamel confessed. &ldquo;I believe I feel these things somewhere,
      because they bring a queer sense of content with them. I am afraid,
      though, that my artistic perceptions are not so keen as some men&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin looked at him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the physical life in your veins&mdash;too splendid to permit you
      abstract pleasures. Compensations again, you see&mdash;compensations. I
      wonder what the law is that governs these things. I have forgotten
      sometimes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;forgotten my own infirmities in the soft
      intoxication of a wonderful seascape. Only,&rdquo; he went on, his face a little
      grey, &ldquo;it is the physical in life which triumphs. There are the hungry
      hours which nothing will satisfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head sank, his chin rested upon his chest. He had all the appearance
      now of a man who talks in bitter earnest. Yet Hamel wondered. He looked
      towards the Tower; there was no sign of Meekins. The sea-gulls went
      screaming above their heads. Mr. Fentolin never moved. His eyes seemed
      half closed. It was only when Hamel rose to his feet that he looked
      swiftly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay with me, I beg you, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am in one of the moods
      when solitude, even for a moment, is dangerous. Do you know what I have
      sometimes thought to myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the planked way which led down the steep, pebbly beach to
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sometimes thought,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that it would be glorious to find
      a friend to stand by my side at the top of the planks, just there, when
      the tide was high, and to bid him loose my chair and to steer it myself,
      to steer it down the narrow path into the arms of the sea. The first touch
      of the salt waves, the last touch of life. Why not? One sleeps without
      fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head suddenly. Meekins had appeared, coming round from the
      back of the Tower. Instantly Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s whole manner changed. He sat
      up in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is arranged, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You dine with us to-night. For the other
      matters of which you have spoken, well, let them rest in the hands of the
      gods. You are not very kind to me. I am not sure whether you would make
      Esther a good husband. I am not sure, even, that I like you. You take no
      pains to make yourself agreeable. Considering that your father was an
      artist, you seem to me rather a dull and uninspired young man. But who can
      tell? There may be things stirring beneath that torpid brain of yours of
      which no other person knows save yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The concentrated gaze of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s keen eyes was hard to meet, but
      Hamel came out of the ordeal without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I can see that I must try
      to earn your better opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel read steadily for the remainder of the morning. It was past one
      o&rsquo;clock when he rose stiffly from his seat among the sand knolls and,
      strolling back to the Tower, opened the door and entered. The cloth was
      laid for luncheon in the little sitting-room, but there were no signs of
      Hannah Cox. He passed on into the kitchen and came to a sudden standstill.
      Once more the memory of his own work passed away from him. Once more he
      was back again among that queer, clouded tangle of strange suspicions, of
      thrilling, half-formed fears, which had assailed him at times ever since
      his arrival at St, David&rsquo;s. He stopped quite short. The words which rose
      to his lips died away. He felt the breathless, compelling need for silence
      and grew tense in the effort to make no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah Cox was kneeling on the stone floor. Her ear was close to the crack
      of the door which led into the boat-house. Her face, half turned from it,
      was set in a strange, concentrated passion of listening; her lips were
      parted, her eyes half closed. She took no more notice of Hamel or his
      arrival than if he had been some useless piece of furniture. Every faculty
      seemed to be absorbed in that one intense effort of listening. There was
      no need of her out-stretched finger. Hamel fell in at once with a mood so
      mesmeric. He, too, listened. The small clock which she had brought with
      her from the village ticked away upon the mantelpiece. The full sea fell
      with placid softness upon the high beach outside. Some slight noise of
      cooking came from the stove. Save for these things there was silence. Yet,
      for a space of time which Hamel could never have measured, they both
      listened. When at last the woman rose to her feet, Hamel, finding words at
      last, was surprised to find that his throat was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Cox?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why were you listening there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was absolutely expressionless. She was busying herself now with a
      small saucepan, and her back was turned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spend my life, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;listening and waiting. One never knows
      when the end may come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the boat-house,&rdquo; Hamel objected. &ldquo;No one has been in there his
      morning, have they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He could go anywhere when he chose, or how
      he chose&mdash;through the keyhole, if he wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why listen?&rdquo; Hamel persisted. &ldquo;There is nothing in there now but some
      odds and ends of machinery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the fire and looked at him for a moment. Her eyes were
      colourless, her tone unemotional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe! There&rsquo;s no harm in listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear anything which made you want to listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;A woman who lives well-nigh alone, as I
      live, in a quiet place, hears things so often that other folk never listen
      to. There&rsquo;s always something in my ears, night or day. Sometimes I am not
      sure whether it&rsquo;s in this world or the other. It was like that with me
      just then. It was for that reason I listened. Your luncheon&rsquo;s ready, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel walked thoughtfully back into his sitting-room. He seated himself
      before a spotless cloth and watched Hannah Cox spread out his well-cooked,
      cleanly-served meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything you want, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall hear you at a
      word. The kitchen door is open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mrs. Cox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lingered there patiently, with the tray in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was some sound,&rdquo; Hamel continued, &ldquo;perhaps a real sound, perhaps a
      fancy, which made you go down on your knees in the kitchen. Tell me what
      it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sound I always hear, sir,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;I hear it in the
      night, and I hear it when I stand by the sea and look out. I have heard it
      for so many years that who can tell whether it comes from this world or
      the other&mdash;the cry of men who die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed out. Hamel looked after her, for a moment, like a man in a
      dream. In his fancy he could see her back again once more in the kitchen,
      kneeling on the stone floor,&mdash;listening!

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      A cold twilight had fallen upon the land when Hamel left the Tower that
      evening and walked briskly along the foot-way to the Hall. Little patches
      of mist hung over the creeks, the sky was almost frosty. The lights from
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall shone like cheerful beacons before him. He hastened up
      the stone steps, crossed the terrace, and passed into the hall. A servant
      conducted him at once to the drawing-room. Mrs. Fentolin, in a pink
      evening dress, with a pink ornament in her hair, held out both her hands.
      In the background, Mr. Fentolin, in his queerly-cut evening clothes, sat
      with folded arms, leaning back in his carriage. He listened grimly to his
      sister-in-law as she stood with Hamel&rsquo;s hands in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Hamel!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How perfectly charming of you to come
      up and relieve a little our sad loneliness! Delightful, I call it, of you.
      I was just saying so to Miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked around the room. Already his heart was beginning to sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fentolin is well, I hope?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but a very naughty girl,&rdquo; her mother declared. &ldquo;I let her go to
      Lady Saxthorpe&rsquo;s to lunch, and now we have had simply the firmest letter
      from Lady Saxthorpe. They insist upon keeping Esther to dine and sleep. I
      have had to send her evening clothes, but you can&rsquo;t tell, Mr. Hamel, how I
      miss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel&rsquo;s disappointment was a little too obvious to pass unnoticed. There
      was a shade of annoyance, too, in his face. Mr. Fentolin smoothly
      intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be quite candid with Mr. Hamel, dear Florence,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I have
      spoken to my sister-in-law and told her the substance of our conversation
      this morning,&rdquo; he proceeded, wheeling his chair nearer to Hamel. &ldquo;She is
      thunderstruck. She wishes to reflect, to consider. Esther chanced to be
      away. We have encouraged her absence for a few more hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; Hamel said simply, &ldquo;that you will give her to me.
      I am not a rich man, but I am fairly well off. I should be willing to live
      exactly where Esther wishes, and I would do my best to make her happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin opened her lips once and closed them again. She laughed a
      little&mdash;a high-pitched, semi-hysterical laugh. The hand which gripped
      her fan was straining so that the blue veins stood out almost like
      whipcord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Esther is very young, Mr. Hamel. We must talk this over. You have known
      her for such a very short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant announced dinner, and Hamel offered his arm to his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Gerald away, too?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do indeed owe you our apologies,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared. &ldquo;Gerald is
      spending a couple of days at the Dormy House at Brancaster&mdash;a golf
      arrangement made some time back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He promised to play with me to-morrow,&rdquo; Hamel remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;He
      said nothing about going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that like most young men of his age he has little memory,&rdquo; Mr.
      Fentolin sighed. &ldquo;However, he will be back to-morrow or the next day. I
      owe you my apologies, Mr. Hamel, for our lack of young people. We must do
      our best to entertain our guest, Florence. You must be at your best, dear.
      You must tell him some of those capital stories of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin shivered for a moment. Hamel, as he handed her to her place,
      was struck by a strange look which she threw upon him, half furtive, full
      of pain. Her hand almost clung to his. She slipped a little, and he held
      her tightly. Then he was suddenly conscious that something hard was being
      pressed into his palm. He drew his hand away at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem a little unsteady this evening, my dear Florence,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin
      remarked, peering across the round table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She eyed him nonchalantly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The floor is slippery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was glad, for a moment, of Mr.
      Hamel&rsquo;s strong hand. Where are those dear puppies? Chow-Chow,&rdquo; she went
      on, &ldquo;come and sit by your mistress at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel&rsquo;s fingers inside his waistcoat pocket were smoothing out the
      crumpled piece of paper which she had passed to him. Soon he had it quite
      flat. Mrs. Fentolin, as though freed from some anxiety, chattered away
      gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I shall apologise to Mr. Hamel at all for the young
      people being away,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Just fancy what we have saved him from&mdash;a
      solitary meal served by Hannah Cox! Do you know that they say she is
      half-witted, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, she has looked after me very well,&rdquo; Hamel observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her intellect is defective,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin remarked, &ldquo;on one point only.
      The good woman is obsessed by the idea that her husband and sons are still
      calling to her from the Dagger Rocks. It is almost pitiful to meet her
      wandering about there on a stormy night. The seacoasts are full of these
      little village tragedies&mdash;real tragedies, too, however insignificant
      they may seem to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s tone was gently sympathetic. He changed the subject a
      moment or two later, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nero fiddles to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while Rome burns. There are hundreds in
      our position, yet it certainly seems queer that we should be sitting here
      so quietly when the whole country is in such a state of excitement. I see
      the press this morning is preaching an immediate declaration of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does seem to be rather the trouble,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Russia, Austria,
      Germany, Italy, and France are all assisting at a Conference to which no
      English representative has been bidden. In a sense, of course, that is
      equivalent to an act of hostility from all these countries towards
      England. The question is whether we have or have not a secret
      understanding with France, and if so, how far she will be bound by it.
      There is a rumour that when Monsieur Deschelles was asked formally whom he
      represented, that he replied&mdash;&lsquo;France and Great Britain.&rsquo; There may
      be something in it. It is hard to see how any English statesman could have
      left unguarded the Mediterranean, with all that it means, trusting simply
      to the faith of a country with whom we have no binding agreement. On the
      other hand, there is the mobilisation of the fleet. If France is really
      faithful, one wonders if there was need for such an extreme step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am out of touch with political affairs,&rdquo; Hamel declared. &ldquo;I have been
      away from England for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, on the other hand,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, his eyes glittering a
      little, &ldquo;have made the study of the political situation in Europe my hobby
      for years. I have sent to me the leading newspapers of Berlin, Rome,
      Paris, St. Petersburg, and Vienna. For two hours every day I read them,
      side by side. It is curious sometimes to note the common understanding
      which seems to exist between the Powers not bound by any formal alliance.
      For years war seemed a very unlikely thing, and now,&rdquo; he added, leaning
      forward in his chair, &ldquo;I pronounce it almost a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at his host a little curiously. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s gentleness of
      expression seemed to have departed. His face was hard, his eyes agleam. He
      had almost the look of a bird of prey. For some reason, the thought of war
      seemed to be a joy to him. Perhaps he read something of Hamel&rsquo;s wonder in
      his expression, for with a shrug of the shoulders he dismissed the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;all these things lie on the knees of the gods. I
      dare say you wonder, Mr. Hamel, why a poor useless creature like myself
      should take the slightest interest in passing events? It is just the
      fascination of the looker-on. I want your opinion about that champagne.
      Florence dear, you must join us. We will drink to Mr. Hamel&rsquo;s health. We
      will perhaps couple that toast in our minds with the sentiment which I am
      sure is not very far from your thoughts, Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel raised his glass and bowed to his host and hostess. He was not
      wholly at his ease. It seemed to him that he was being watched with a
      queer persistence by both of them. Mrs. Fentolin continued to talk and
      laugh with a gaiety which was too obviously forced. Mr. Fentolin posed for
      a while as the benevolent listener. He mildly applauded his
      sister-in-law&rsquo;s stories, and encouraged Hamel in the recital of some of
      his reminiscences. Suddenly the door was opened. Miss Price appeared. She
      walked smoothly across the room and stood by Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s side. Stooping
      down, she whispered in his ear. He pushed his chair back a little from the
      table. His face was dark with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said not before ten to-night,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she spoke in his ear, so softly that the sound of her voice itself
      scarcely travelled even as far as where Hamel was sitting. Mr. Fentolin
      looked steadfastly for a moment at his sister-in-law and from her to
      Hamel. Then he backed his chair away front the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to ask to be excused for three minutes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must
      speak upon the telephone. It is a call from some one who declares that
      they have important news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the steering-wheel of his chair, and with Miss Price by his side
      passed across the dining-room, out of the Oasis of rose-shaded lights into
      the shadows, and through the open door. From there he turned his head
      before he disappeared, as though to watch his guest. Mrs. Fentolin was
      busy fondling one of her dogs, which she had raised to her lap, and Hamel
      was watching her with a tolerant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Koto, you little idiot, why can&rsquo;t you sit up like your sister? Was its
      tail in the way, then! Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she whispered under her breath, so
      softly that he barely caught the words, although he was only a few feet
      away, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me. I feel as though we were being watched all the
      time. You can destroy that piece of paper in your pocket. All that it says
      is &lsquo;Leave here immediately after dinner.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel sipped his wine in a nonchalant fashion. His fingers had strayed
      over the silky coat of the little dog, which she had held out as though
      for his inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What excuse can I make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invent one,&rdquo; she insisted swiftly. &ldquo;Leave here before ten o&rsquo;clock. Don&rsquo;t
      let anything keep you. And destroy that piece of paper in your pocket, if
      you can&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs. Fentolin&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught up one of her absurd little pets and held it to her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins is in the doorway,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with me, please. You are in danger you know nothing about.
      Pass me the cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in her chair, smoking quickly. She held one of the dogs on
      her knee and talked rubbish to it. Hamel watched her, leaning back in his
      carved oak chair, and he found it hard to keep the pity from his eyes. The
      woman was playing a part, playing it with desperate and pitiful
      earnestness, a part which seemed the more tragical because of the soft
      splendour of their surroundings. From the shadowy walls, huge, dimly-seen
      pictures hung about them, a strange and yet impressive background. Their
      small round dining-table, with its rare cut glass, its perfect
      appointments, its bowls of pink roses, was like a spot of wonderful colour
      in the great room. Two men servants stood at the sideboard a few yards
      away, a triumph of negativeness. The butler, who had been absent for a
      moment, stood now silently waiting behind his master&rsquo;s place. Hamel was
      oppressed, during those few minutes of waiting, by a curious sense of
      unreality, as though he were taking part in some strange tableau. There
      was something unreal about his surroundings and his own presence there;
      something unreal in the atmosphere, charged as it seemed to be with some
      omen of impending happenings; something unreal in that whispered warning,
      those few hoarsely uttered words which had stolen to his hearing across
      the clusters of drooping roses; the absurd babble of the woman, who sat
      there with tragic things under the powder with which her face was daubed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Koto must learn to sit upon his tail&mdash;like that. No, not another
      grape till he sits up. There, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning forward with a grape between her teeth, towards the tiny
      animal who was trying in vain to balance his absurdly shaped little body
      upon the tablecloth. Hamel, without looking around, knew quite well what
      was happening. Soon he heard the click of the chair. Mr. Fentolin was back
      in his place. His skin seemed paler and more parchment-like than ever. His
      eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he announced quietly, as he raised his wine-glass to his lips
      with the air of one needing support, &ldquo;that we entertained an angel
      unawares here. This Mr. Dunster is lost for the second time. A very
      important personage he turns out to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the American whom Gerald brought home after the accident?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Fentolin asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin replied. &ldquo;He insisted upon continuing his journey before he
      was strong enough. I warned him of what might happen. He has evidently
      been take ill somewhere. It seems that he was on his way to The Hague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he has disappeared altogether this time?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has found his way to The Hague safely enough. He is lying there at
      a hotel in the city, but he is unconscious. There is some talk about his
      having been robbed on the way. At any rate, they are tracing his movements
      backwards. We are to be honoured with a visit from one of Scotland Yard&rsquo;s
      detectives, to reconstruct his journey from here. Our quiet little corner
      of the world is becoming quite notorious. Florence dear, you are tired. I
      can see it in your eyes. Your headache continues, I am sure. We will not
      be selfish. Mr. Hamel and I are going to have a long evening in the
      library. Let me recommend a phenacetin and bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose at once to her feet, with a dog under either arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the phenacetin,&rdquo; she promised, &ldquo;but I hate going to bed early.
      Shall I see you again, I wonder, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this evening, I fear,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am going to ask Mr. Fentolin
      to excuse me early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed out of the room. Hamel escorted her as far as the door and then
      returned. Mr. Fentolin was sitting quite still in his chair. His eyes were
      fixed upon the tablecloth. He looked up quickly as Hamel resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in earnest, I hope, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you tell me
      that you must leave early? I have been anticipating a long evening. My
      library is filled with books on South America which I want to discuss with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another evening, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Hamel begged. &ldquo;To-night I must ask
      you to excuse my hurrying away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin looked up from underneath his eyelids. His glance was quick
      and penetrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this haste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I had an idea while I was reading
      an article on cantilever bridges this morning. I want to work it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin glanced behind him. The door of the dining-room was closed.
      The servants had disappeared. Meekins alone, looking more like a prize
      fighter than ever in his somber evening clothes, had taken the place of
      the butler behind his master&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin said quietly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin pointed to the little pile of books upon the table, the deep
      easy-chair, the green-shaded lamps, the decanter of wine. He had insisted
      upon a visit, however brief, to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a student&rsquo;s appeal which I make to you, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said, with a
      whimsical smile. &ldquo;Here we are in my study, with the door closed, secure
      against interruption, a bright fire in the grate, a bowling and
      ever-increasing wind outside. Let us go together over the ground of your
      last wonderful expedition over the Andes. You will find that I am not
      altogether ignorant of your profession, or of those very interesting
      geological problems which you spoke of in connection with that marvellous
      railway scheme. We will discuss them side by side as sybarites, hang
      ourselves around with cigarette smoke, drink wine, and presently coffee.
      It is necessary, is it not, for many reasons, that we become better
      acquainted? You realise that, I am sure, and you will not persist in
      returning to your selfish solitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel&rsquo;s eyes were fixed a little longingly upon some of the volumes with
      which the table was covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think me ungrateful or churlish, Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; he begged.
      &ldquo;I have a habit of keeping promises which I make to myself, and to-night I
      have made myself a promise that I will be back at the Tower by ten
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are obdurate?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin busied himself with the handle of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;is there any other person save yourself to whom
      you have given this mysterious promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Hamel replied promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a person very sensitive to atmosphere,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued
      slowly. &ldquo;Since the unfortunate visit of this man Dunster, I seem to have
      been conscious of a certain suspicion, a little cloud of suspicion under
      which I seem to live and move, even among the members of my own household.
      My sister-in-law is nervous and hysterical; Gerald has been sullen and
      disobedient; Esther has avoided me. And now&mdash;well, I find even your
      attitude a little difficult to understand. What does it mean, Mr. Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the confidence of the different members of your family,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;So far as I, personally, am concerned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases me sometimes,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin interrupted, &ldquo;to interfere to some
      extent in the affairs of the outside world. If I do so, that is my
      business. I do it for my own amusement. It is at no time a serious
      position which I take up. Have I by any chance, Mr. Hamel, become an
      object of suspicion to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are matters in which you are concerned,&rdquo; Hamel admitted, &ldquo;which I
      do not understand, but I see no purpose in discussing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin wheeled his chair round in a semicircle. He was now between
      the door and Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weaker mortals than I, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;have wielded before
      now the powers of life and death. From my chair I can make the lightnings
      bite. Science has done away with the triumph of muscularity. Even as we
      are here together at this moment, Mr. Hamel, if we should disagree, it is
      I who am the preordained victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel saw the glitter in his hand. This was the end, then, of all doubt!
      He remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspicions which are, in a sense, absurd,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;have
      grown until I find them obtrusive and obnoxious. What have I to do with
      Mr. John P. Dunster? I sent him out from my house. If he is lost or ill,
      the affair is not mine. Yet one by one those around me are falling away. I
      told you an hour ago that Gerald was at Brancaster. It is a lie. He has
      left this house, but no soul in it knows his destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he has run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I can surmise is that he has followed Dunster,&rdquo; he proceeded.
      &ldquo;He has an idea that in some way I robbed or injured the man. He has
      broken the bond of relationship between us. He has broken his solemn vow.
      He has run a grave and terrible risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of Miss Esther?&rdquo; Hamel asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent her away,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied, &ldquo;until we come to a clear
      understanding, you and I. You seem to be a harmless enough person, Mr.
      Hamel but appearances are sometimes deceptive. It has been suggested to me
      that you are a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; Hamel demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By those in whom I trust,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin told him sternly. &ldquo;You are a
      friend of Reginald Kinsley. You met him in Norwich the other day&mdash;secretly.
      Kinsley&rsquo;s chief is a member of the Government. He is one of those who will
      find eternal obloquy if The Hague Conference comes to a successful
      termination. For some strange reason, I am supposed to have robbed or
      harmed the one man in the world whose message might bring to nought that
      Conference. Are you here to watch me, Mr. Hamel? Are you one of those who
      believe that I am either in the pay of a foreign country, or that my
      harmless efforts to interest myself in great things are efforts inimical
      to this country; that I am, in short, a traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit that many of your actions are incomprehensible,&rdquo; Hamel
      replied slowly. &ldquo;There are things here which I do not understand&mdash;which
      certainly require explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, why do you make them your business?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin persisted. &ldquo;If
      indeed the course which I steer is a harmless one,&rdquo; he continued, with a
      strange new glitter in his eyes, &ldquo;then you are an impertinent stranger to
      whom my doors cannot any longer be open. If you have taken advantage of my
      hospitality to spy upon me and my actions, if indeed you have a mission
      here, then you can carry it with you down into hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that you are threatening me?&rdquo; Hamel murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely that, my young friend. I am not quite the obvious sort of
      villain who flourishes revolvers and lures his victims into secret
      chambers. These words to you are simply words of warning. I am not like
      other men, neither am I used to being crossed. When I am crossed, I am
      dangerous. Leave here, if you will, in safety, and mind your own affairs;
      but if you show one particle of curiosity as to mine, if you interfere in
      matters which concern me and me only, remember that you are encircled by
      powers which are entirely ruthless, absolutely omnipotent. You can walk
      back to the Tower to-night and remember that there isn&rsquo;t a step you take
      which might not be your last if I willed it, and never a soul the wiser.
      There&rsquo;s a very hungry little mother here who takes her victims and holds
      them tight. You can hear her calling to you now. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his finger. The tide had turned, and through the half-open
      window came the low thunder of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You decline to share my evening,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin concluded. &ldquo;Let it be so.
      Go your own way, Hamel, only take care that your way does not cross mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He backed his chair slowly and pressed the bell. Hamel felt himself
      dismissed. He passed out into the hall. The door of the drawing-room stood
      open, and he heard the sound of Mrs. Fentolin&rsquo;s thin voice singing some
      little French song. He hesitated and then stepped in. With one hand she
      beckoned him to her, continuing to play all the time. He stepped over to
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to make my adieux,&rdquo; he whispered, with a glance towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are leaving, then?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin is in a strange humour,&rdquo; she went on, a moment later, after
      she had struck the final chords of her song. &ldquo;There are things going on
      around us which no one can understand. I think that one of his schemes has
      miscarried; he has gone too far. He suspects you; I cannot tell you why or
      how. If only you would go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Esther?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must leave her,&rdquo; she cried, with a little catch in her throat.
      &ldquo;Gerald has broken away. Esther and I must carry still the burden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She motioned him to go. He touched her fingers for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fentolin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been a good many years making up my
      mind. Now that I have done so, I do not think that any one will keep
      Esther from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a little pitifully, a little wistfully. Then, with a
      shrug of the shoulders, she turned round to the piano and recommenced to
      play. Hamel took his coat and hat from a servant who was waiting in the
      hall and passed out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked briskly until he reached the Tower. The wind had risen, but
      there was still enough light to help him on his way. The little building
      was in complete darkness. He opened the door and stepped into the
      sitting-room, lit the lamp, and, holding it over his head, went down the
      passage and into the kitchen. Then he gave a start. The lamp nearly
      slipped from his fingers. Kneeling on the stone floor, in very much the
      same attitude as he had found her earlier in the day, Hannah Cox was
      crouching patiently by the door which led into the boat-house, her face
      expressionless, her ear turned towards the crack. She was still listening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel set down the lamp upon the table. He glanced at the little clock
      upon the dresser; it was a quarter past ten. The woman had observed his
      entrance, although it seemed in no way to have discomposed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the time, Mrs. Cox?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You ought to have been home
      hours ago. What are you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet. Her expression was one of dogged but patient
      humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started for home before nine o&rsquo;clock, sir,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;but it was
      worse than ever to-night. All the way along by the sea I seemed to hear
      their voices, so I came back. I came back to listen. I have been listening
      for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at her with a frown upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cox,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish I could understand what it is that you have
      in your mind. Those are not real voices that you hear; you cannot believe
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not real voices,&rdquo; she repeated, without the slightest expression in her
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! And tell me what connection you find between these fancies
      of yours and that room? Why do you come and listen here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she answered patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have some reason,&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reason,&rdquo; she assured him, &ldquo;only some day I shall see behind
      these doors. Afterwards, I shall hear the voices no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was busy tying a shawl around her head. Hamel watched her, still
      puzzled. He could not get rid of the idea that there was some method
      behind her madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;I have found you listening here before. Have you ever heard
      anything suspicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard nothing yet,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;nothing that counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t we clear this matter up sensibly? Do you
      believe that there is anybody in there? Do you believe the place is being
      used in any way for a wrong purpose? If so, we will insist upon having the
      keys from Mr. Fentolin. He cannot refuse. The place is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin would not give you the keys, sir,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;If he did,
      it would be useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to break the door in?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not do it, sir,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;not you nor anybody else. The
      door is thicker than my fist, of solid oak. It was a mechanic from New
      York who fitted the locks. I have heard it said in the village&mdash;Bill
      Hamas, the carpenter, declares that there are double doors. The workmen
      who were employed here were housed in a tent upon the beach and sent home
      the day they finished their job. They were never allowed in the village.
      They were foreigners, most of them. They came from nobody knows where, and
      when they had finished they disappeared. Why was that, sir? What is there
      inside which Mr. Fentolin needs to guard so carefully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin has invented something,&rdquo; Hamel explained. &ldquo;He keeps the
      model in there. Inventors are very jealous of their work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down upon the floor for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be here at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, sir. I will give you
      your breakfast at the usual time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel opened the door for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Mrs. Cox,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you like me to walk a little way
      with you? It&rsquo;s a lonely path to the village, and the dikes are full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no, sir,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonely way, right enough, but
      it isn&rsquo;t loneliness that frightens me. I am less afraid out with the winds
      and the darkness than under this roof. If I lose my way and wander all
      night upon the marsh, I&rsquo;ll be safer out there than you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed away, and Hamel watched her disappear into the darkness. Then
      he dragged out a bowl of tobacco and filled a pipe. Although he was half
      ashamed of himself, he strolled back once more into the kitchen, and,
      drawing up a stool, he sat down just where he had discovered Hannah Cox,
      sat still and listened. No sound of any sort reached him. He sat there for
      ten minutes. Then he scrambled to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mad, of course!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mixed himself a whisky and soda, relit his pipe, which had gone out,
      and drew up an easy-chair to the fire which she had left him in the
      sitting-room. The wind had increased in violence, and the panes of his
      window rattled continually. He yawned and tried to fancy that he was
      sleepy. It was useless. He was compelled to admit the truth&mdash;that his
      nerves were all on edge. In a sense he was afraid. The thought of bed
      repelled him. He had not a single impulse towards repose. Outside, the
      wind all the time was gathering force. More than once his window was
      splashed with the spray carried on by the wind which followed the tide. He
      sat quite still and tried to think calmly, tried to piece together in his
      mind the sequence of events which had brought him to this part of the
      world and which had led to his remaining where he was, an undesired
      hanger-on at the threshold of Miles Fentolin. He had the feeling that
      to-night he had burned his boats. There was no longer any pretence of
      friendliness possible between him and this strange creature. Mr. Fentolin
      suspected him, realised that he himself was suspected. But of what? Hamel
      moved in his chair restlessly. Sometimes that gathering cloud of suspicion
      seemed to him grotesque. Of what real harm could he be capable, this
      little autocrat who from his chair seemed to exercise such a malign
      influence upon every one with whom he was brought into contact? Hamel
      sighed. The riddle was insoluble. With a sudden rush of warmer and more
      joyous feelings, he let the subject slip away from him. He closed his eyes
      and dreamed for a while. There was a new world before him, joys which only
      so short a time ago he had fancied had passed him by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up in his chair with a start. The fire had become merely a handful
      of grey ashes, his limbs were numb and stiff. The lamp was flickering out.
      He had been dozing, how long he had no idea. Something had awakened him
      abruptly. There was a cold draught blowing through the room. He turned his
      head, his hands still gripping the sides of his chair. His heart gave a
      leap. The outer door was a few inches open, was being held open by some
      invisible force. There was some one there, some one on the point of
      entering stealthily. Even as he watched, the crack became a little wider.
      He sat with his eyes riveted upon that opening space. The unseen hand was
      still at work. Every instant he expected to see a face thrust forward. The
      sensation of absolute physical fear by which he was oppressed was a
      revelation to him. He found himself wishing almost feverishly that he was
      armed. The physical strength in which he had trusted seemed to him at that
      instant a valueless and impotent thing. There was a splash of spray or
      raindrops against the window and through the crack in the door. The lamp
      chimney hissed and spluttered and finally the light went out. The room was
      in sudden darkness. Hamel sprang then to his feet. Silence had become an
      intolerable thing. He felt the close presence of another human being
      creeping in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no direct answer, only the door was pushed a little further
      open. He had stepped close to it now. The sweep of the wind was upon his
      face, although in the black darkness he could see nothing. And then a
      sudden recollection flashed in upon him. From his trousers pocket he
      snatched a little electric torch. In an instant his thumb had pressed the
      button. He turned it upon the door. The shivering white hand which held it
      open was plainly in view. It was the hand of a woman! He stepped swiftly
      forward. A dark figure almost fell into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fentolin!&rdquo; he exclaimed, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hysterical cry, choked and subdued, broke from her lips. He half
      carried, half led her to his easy-chair. Suddenly steadied by the presence
      of this unlooked-for emergency, he closed the outside door and relit the
      lamp with firm fingers. Then he turned to face her, and his amazement at
      this strange visit became consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still in her dinner-gown of black satin, but it was soaked through
      with the rain and hung about her like a black shroud. She had lost one
      shoe, and there was a great hole in her silk stocking. Her hair was all
      disarranged; one of its numerous switches was hanging down over her ear.
      The rouge upon her cheeks had run down on to her neck. She sat there,
      looking at him out of her hollow eyes like some trapped animal. She was
      shaking with fear. It was fear, not faintness, which kept her silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, please, what is the matter?&rdquo; he insisted, speaking as
      indifferently as he could. &ldquo;Tell me at once what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock it!&rdquo; she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned down the latch and drew the bolt. The sound seemed to give her a
      little courage. Her fingers went to her throat for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me some water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He poured out some soda-water. She drank only a sip and put it down again.
      He began to be alarmed. She had the appearance of one who has suddenly
      lost her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me just what has happened?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;If I can help in any
      way, you know I will. But you must tell me. Do you realise that it is
      three o&rsquo;clock? I should have been in bed, only I went to sleep over the
      fire here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It is just the wind that has taken away my
      breath. It was a hard struggle to get here. Listen&mdash;you are our
      friend, Mr. Hamel&mdash;Esther&rsquo;s and mine? Swear that you are our friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour, I am,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;You should know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For eight years,&rdquo; she went on, her voice clear enough now, although it
      seemed charged with a curious metallic vibration, &ldquo;for eight years we&rsquo;ve
      borne it, all three of us, slaves, bound hand and foot, lashed with his
      tongue, driven along the path of his desires. We have seen evil things. We
      have been on the point of rebellion, and he&rsquo;s come a little nearer and
      he&rsquo;s pointed back. He has taken me by the hand, and I have walked by the
      side of his chair, loathing it, loathing myself, out on to the terrace and
      down below, just where it happened. You know what happened there, Mr.
      Hamel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean where Mr. Fentolin met with his accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no accident!&rdquo; she cried, glancing for a moment around her. &ldquo;It was
      no accident! It was my husband who took him up and threw him over the
      terrace, down below; my husband who tried to kill him; Esther&rsquo;s father&mdash;Gerald&rsquo;s
      father! Miles was in the Foreign Office then, and he did something
      disgraceful. He sold a secret to Austria. He was always a great gambler,
      and he was in debt. Seymour found out about it. He followed him down here.
      They met upon the terrace. I&mdash;I saw it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has known the truth,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has ever known,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;and our broken lives have been the
      price. It was Miles himself who made the bargain. We&mdash;we can&rsquo;t go on,
      Mr. Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; Hamel said softly. &ldquo;You suffer everything from
      Miles Fentolin because he kept the secret. Very well, that belongs to the
      past. Something has happened, something to-night, which has brought you
      here. Tell me about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more her voice began to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;terrible things&mdash;horrible things,&rdquo; she faltered.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve held our peace. Perhaps it&rsquo;s been nearly as bad before, but we&rsquo;ve
      closed our eyes; we haven&rsquo;t wanted to know. Now&mdash;we can&rsquo;t help it.
      Mr. Hamel, Esther isn&rsquo;t at Lord Saxthorpe&rsquo;s. She never went there. They
      didn&rsquo;t ask her. And Dunster&mdash;the man Dunster&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Esther?&rdquo; Hamel interrupted suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked up away from you, locked up because she rebelled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dunster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. Her eyes were filled with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he left the Hall&mdash;I saw him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Dunster. It was the man Miles makes use of&mdash;Ryan, the
      librarian. He was once an actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Dunster, then?&rdquo; Hamel asked quickly. &ldquo;What has become of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her lips and closed them again, struggled to speak and failed.
      She sat there, breathing quickly, but silent. The power of speech had
      gone.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hamel, for the next few minutes, forgot everything else in his efforts to
      restore to consciousness his unexpected visitor. He rebuilt the fire,
      heated some water upon his spirit lamp, and forced some hot drink between
      the lips of the woman who was now almost in a state of collapse. Then he
      wrapped her round in his own ulster and drew her closer to the fire. He
      tried during those few moments to put away the memory of all that she had
      told him. Gradually she began to recover. She opened her eyes and drew a
      little sigh. She made no effort at speech, however. She simply lay and
      looked at him like some wounded animal. He came over to her side and
      chafed one of her cold hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you begin to look more like yourself now. You
      are quite safe in here, and, for Esther&rsquo;s sake as well as your own, you
      know that I am your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and her fingers gently pressed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us see where we are,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Tell me exactly why you
      risked so much by leaving St. David&rsquo;s Hall to-night and coming down here.
      Isn&rsquo;t there any chance that he might find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It was Lucy Price who sent me. She came to
      my room just as I was undressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy Price,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The secretary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! She told me that she had meant to come to you herself. She sent me
      instead. She thought it best. This man Dunster is being kept alive because
      there is something Miles wants him to tell him, and he won&rsquo;t. But
      to-night, if he is still alive, if he won&rsquo;t tell, they mean to make away
      with him. They are afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Price told you this?&rdquo; Hamel asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! She said so. She knows&mdash;she knows everything. She has been like
      the rest of us. She, too, has suffered. She, too, has reached the breaking
      point. She loved him before the accident. She has been his slave ever
      since. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly clutched his arm. They were both silent. There was nothing to
      be heard but the wind. She leaned a little closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy Price sent me here to-night because she was afraid that it was
      to-night they meant to take him from his hiding-place and kill him. The
      police have left off searching for Mr. Dunster in Yarmouth and at The
      Hague. There is a detective in the neighbourhood and another one on his
      way here. They are afraid to keep him alive any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Mr. Fentolin when you left?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked Lucy Price that,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;When she came to my room, there
      were no signs of his leaving. She told me to come and tell you everything.
      Do you know where Mr. Dunster is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within a few yards of here,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He is in the boat-house, the
      place where Miles told you he kept a model of his invention. They brought
      him here the night before they put his clothes on Ryan and sent him off
      disguised as Mr. Dunster, in the car to Yarmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel started up, but she clutched at his arm and pulled him back. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       she cried, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t break in! There are double doors and a wonderful
      lock. The boat-house is yours; the building is yours. In the morning you
      must demand the keys&mdash;if he does not come to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are we to know,&rdquo; Hamel asked, &ldquo;if he comes to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go outside,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Look towards St. David&rsquo;s Hall and tell me
      how many lights you can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew back the bolt, unlatched the door, and stepped out into the
      darkness. The wind and the driving rain beat against his face. A cloud of
      spray enveloped and soaked him. Like lamps hung in the sky, the lights of
      St. David&rsquo;s Hall shone out through the black gulf. He counted them
      carefully; then he stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are seven,&rdquo; he told her, closing the door with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She counted upon her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must come and see,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I must be sure. Help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her to her feet, and they staggered out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she went on, gripping his arm. &ldquo;You see that row of lights? If
      anything happens, if Mr. Fentolin leaves the Hall to-night to come down
      here, a light will appear on the left in the far corner. We must watch for
      that light. We must watch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words, whispered hoarsely into his ear, suddenly died away. Even as
      they stood there, far away from the other lights, another one shone
      suddenly out in the spot towards which she had pointed, and continued to
      burn steadily. He felt the woman who was clinging to his arm become
      suddenly a dead weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was right!&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin moaned. &ldquo;He is coming down to-night! He is
      preparing to leave now; perhaps he has already started! What shall we do?
      What shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel was conscious of a gathering sense of excitement. He, too, looked at
      the signal which was flashing out its message towards them. Then he
      gripped his companion&rsquo;s arm and almost carried her back into the
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;you can do nothing further. You have done
      your part and done it well. Stay where you are and wait. The rest belongs
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can you do?&rdquo; she demanded, her voice shaking with fear. &ldquo;Meekins
      will come with him, and Doctor Sarson, unless he is here already. What can
      you do against them? Meekins can break any ordinary man&rsquo;s back, and Mr.
      Fentolin will have a revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel threw another log on to the fire and drew her chair closer to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about,&rdquo; he declared cheerfully. &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin is too clever to
      attempt violence, except as a last resource. He knows that I have friends
      in London who would need some explanation of my disappearance. Stay here
      and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recognised the note of authority in his tone, and she bowed her head.
      Then she looked up at him; she was a changed woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have done ill to drag you into our troubles, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;and yet, I believe in you. I believe that you really care for
      Esther. If you can help us now, it will be for your happiness, too. You
      are a man. God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel groped his way round the side of the Tower and took up a position at
      the extreme corner of the landward side of the building, within a yard of
      the closed doors. The light far out upon the left was still gleaming
      brightly, but two of the others in a line with it had disappeared. He
      flattened himself against the wall and waited, listening intently, his
      eyes straining through the darkness. Yet they were almost upon him before
      he had the slightest indication of their presence. A single gleam of light
      in the path, come and gone like a flash, the gleam of an electric torch
      directed momentarily towards the road, was his first indication that they
      were near. A moment or two later he heard the strange click, click of the
      little engine attached to Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s chair. Hamel set his teeth and
      stepped a few inches further back. The darkness was so intense that they
      were actually within a yard or so of him before he could even dimly
      discern their shapes. There were three of them&mdash;Mr. Fentolin in his
      chair, Doctor Sarson, and Meekins. They paused for a moment while the
      latter produced a key. Hamel distinctly heard a slow, soft whisper from
      Doctor Sarson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go round to the front and see that he is in bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin replied calmly. &ldquo;It is nearly four o&rsquo;clock. Better
      not to risk the sound of your footsteps upon the pebbles. Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door swung noiselessly open. The darkness was so complete that even
      though Hamel could have touched them with an outstretched hand, their
      shapes were invisible. Hamel, who had formed no definite plans, had no
      time to hesitate. As the last one disappeared through the door, he, too,
      slipped in. He turned abruptly to the left and, holding his breath, stood
      against the wall. The door closed behind them. The gleam of the electric
      light flashed across the stone floor and rested for a moment upon a
      trap-door, which Meekins had already stooped to lift. It fell back
      noiselessly upon rubber studs, and Meekins immediately slipped through it
      a ladder, on either side of which was a grooved stretch of board,
      evidently fashioned to allow Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s carriage to pass down. Hamel
      held his breath. The moment for him was critical. If the light flashed
      once in his direction, he must be discovered. Both Meekins and Doctor
      Sarson, however, were intent upon the task of steering Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s
      little carriage down below. They placed the wheels in the two grooves, and
      Meekins secured the carriage with a rope which he let run through his
      fingers. As soon as the little vehicle had apparently reached the bottom,
      he turned, thrust the electric torch in his pocket, and stepped lightly
      down the ladder. Doctor Sarson followed his example. They disappeared in
      perfect silence and left the door open. Presently a gleam of light came
      travelling up, from which Hamel knew that they had lit a lamp below. Very
      softly he crept across the floor, threw himself upon his stomach and
      peered down. Below him was a room, or rather a cellar, parts of which
      seemed to have been cut out of the solid rock. Immediately underneath was
      a plain iron bedstead, on which was lying stretched the figure of a man.
      In those first few moments Hamel failed altogether to recognise Mr.
      Dunster. He was thin and white, and he seemed to have shrunken; his face,
      with its coarse growth of beard, seemed like the face of an old man. Yet
      the eyes were open, eyes dull and heavy as though with pain. So far no
      word had been spoken, but at that moment Mr. Fentolin broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear guest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I bring you our most sincere apologies. It has
      gone very much against the grain, I can assure you, to have neglected you
      for so long a time. It is entirely the fault of the very troublesome young
      man who occupies the other portion of this building. In the daytime his
      presence makes it exceedingly difficult for us to offer you those little
      attentions which you might naturally expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man upon the bed neither moved nor changed his position in any way.
      Nor did he speak. All power of initiative seemed to have deserted him. He
      lay quite still, his eyes fixed upon Mr. Fentolin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes a time,&rdquo; the latter continued, &ldquo;when every one of us is
      confronted with what might be described as the crisis of our lives. Yours
      has come, my guest, at precisely this moment. It is, if my watch tells me
      the truth, five and twenty minutes to four. It is the last day of April.
      The year you know. You have exactly one minute to decide whether you will
      live a short time longer, or whether you will on this last day of April,
      and before&mdash;say, a quarter to four, make that little journey the
      nature of which you and I have discussed more than once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the man upon the bed made no movement nor any reply. Mr. Fentolin
      sighed and beckoned to Doctor Sarson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;that that wonderful drug of yours, Doctor,
      has been even a little too far-reaching in its results. It has kept our
      friend so quiet that he has lost even the power of speech, perhaps even
      the desire to speak. A little restorative, I think&mdash;just a few
      drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson nodded silently. He drew from his pocket a little phial and
      poured into a wine-glass which stood on a table by the side of the bed,
      half a dozen drops of some ruby-coloured liquid, to which he added a
      tablespoonful of water. Then he leaned once more over the bed and poured
      the contents of the glass between the lips of the semi-conscious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him two minutes,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;He will be able to speak then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin nodded and leaned back in his chair. He glanced around the
      room a little critically. There was a thick carpet upon the floor, a sofa
      piled with cushions in one corner, and several other articles of
      furniture. The walls, however, were uncovered and were stained with damp.
      A great pink fungus stood out within a few inches of the bed, a grim
      mixture of exquisite colouring and loathsome imperfections. The atmosphere
      was fetid. Meekins suddenly struck a match and lit some grains of powder
      in a saucer. A curious odour of incense stole through the place. Mr.
      Fentolin nodded appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Really, the atmosphere here is positively
      unpleasant. I am ashamed to think that our guest has had to put up with it
      so long. And yet,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I think we must call it his own fault. I
      trust that he will no longer be obstinate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the restorative began to show itself. The man on the bed
      moved restlessly. His eyes were no longer altogether expressionless. He
      was staring at Mr. Fentolin as one looks at some horrible vision. Mr.
      Fentolin smiled pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are looking more like your old self, my dear Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I need repeat what I said when I first came,
      need I? You have just to utter that one word, and your little visit to us
      will be at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked around at all of them. He raised himself a little on his
      elbow. For the first time, Hamel, crouching above, recognised any likeness
      to Mr. John P. Dunster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in hell first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face momentarily darkened. He moved a little nearer to the
      man upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunster,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am in grim earnest. Never mind arguments. Never
      mind why I am on the other side. They are restless about you in America.
      Unless I can cable that word to-morrow morning, they&rsquo;ll communicate direct
      with The Hague, and I shall have had my trouble for nothing. It is not my
      custom to put up with failure. Therefore, let me tell you that no single
      one of my threats has been exaggerated. My patience has reached its
      breaking point. Give me that word, or before four o&rsquo;clock strikes, you
      will find yourself in a new chamber, among the corpses of those misguided
      fishermen, mariners of ancient days, and a few others. It&rsquo;s only a matter
      of fifty yards out to the great sea pit below the Dagger Rocks&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      spoken to you about it before, haven&rsquo;t I? So surely as I speak to you of
      it at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s speech came to an abrupt termination. A convulsive movement
      of Meekins&rsquo;, an expression of blank amazement on the part of Doctor
      Sarson, had suddenly checked the words upon his lips. He turned his head
      quickly in the direction towards which they had been gazing, towards which
      in fact, at that moment, Meekins, with a low cry, had made a fruitless
      spring. The ladder down which they had descended was slowly disappearing.
      Meekins, with a jump, missed the last rung by only a few inches. Some
      unseen hand was drawing it up. Already the last few feet were vanishing in
      mid-air. Mr. Fentolin sat quite quiet and still. He looked through the
      trap-door and saw Hamel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most ingenious and, I must confess, most successful, my young friend!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed pleasantly. &ldquo;When you have made the ladder quite secure, perhaps
      you will be so good as to discuss this little matter with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no immediate reply. The eyes of all four men were turned now
      upon that empty space through which the ladder had finally disappeared.
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s fingers disappeared within the pocket of his coat.
      Something very bright was glistening in his hand when he withdrew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and parley with us, Mr. Hamel,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;You will not find us
      unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel&rsquo;s voice came back in reply, but Hamel himself kept well away from
      the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are unpropitious. A little time for reflection
      will do you no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trap-doors were suddenly closed. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face, as he looked up,
      became diabolic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are trapped!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;caught like rats in a hole!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A gleam of day was in the sky as Hamel, with Mrs. Fentolin by his side,
      passed along the path which led from the Tower to St. David&rsquo;s Hall. Lights
      were still burning from its windows; the outline of the building itself
      was faintly defined against the sky. Behind him, across the sea, was that
      one straight line of grey merging into silver. The rain had ceased and the
      wind had dropped. On either side of them stretched the brimming creeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we get into the house without waking any one?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite easily,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;The front door is never barred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked by his side, swiftly and with surprising vigour. In the still,
      grey light, her face was more ghastly than ever, but there was a new
      firmness about her mouth, a new decision in her tone. They reached the
      Hall without further speech, and she led the way to a small door on the
      eastern side, through which they entered noiselessly and passed along a
      little passage out into the hall. A couple of lights were still burning.
      The place seemed full of shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ring up London on the telephone,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know that
      there is a detective either in the neighbourhood or on his way here, but I
      shall tell my friend that he had better come down himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to release Esther,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is locked in her room. The
      telephone is in the study. I will come down there to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed silently up the broad staircase. Hamel groped his way across
      the hall into the library. He turned on the small electric reading-lamp
      and drew up a chair to the side of the telephone. Even as he lifted the
      receiver to his ear, he looked around him half apprehensively. It seemed
      as though every moment he would hear the click of Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got the exchange at Norwich without difficulty, and a few minutes later
      a sleepy reply came from the number he had rung up in London. It was
      Kinsley&rsquo;s servant who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to Mr. Kinsley at once upon most important business,&rdquo;
       Hamel announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry, sir,&rdquo; the man repelled. &ldquo;Mr. Kinsley left town last night for
      the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo; Hamel demanded quickly. &ldquo;You can tell me. You know
      who I am; I am Mr. Hamel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into Norfolk somewhere, sir. He went with several other gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Bullen?&rdquo; Hamel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man admitted the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me if any of the people with whom Mr. Kinsley left London
      were connected with the police?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, sir,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;The gentlemen started in a motor-car
      and were going to drive all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel laid down the receiver. At any rate, he would not be left long with
      this responsibility upon him. He walked out into the hall. The house was
      still wrapped in deep silence. Then, from somewhere above him, coming down
      the stairs, he heard the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s gown. He looked up, and saw
      Miss Price, fully dressed, coming slowly towards him. She held up her
      finger and led the way back into the library. She was dressed as neatly as
      ever, but there was a queer light in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Mrs. Seymour Fentolin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She tells me that you have
      left Mr. Fentolin and the others in the subterranean room of the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have Dunster down there,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I followed them in; it
      seemed the best thing to do. I have a friend from London who is on his way
      down here now with some detective officers, to enquire into the matter of
      Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to leave them where they are until these people arrive?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he replied, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to
      have had time to consider even what to do. The opportunity came, and I
      embraced it. There they are, and they won&rsquo;t dare to do any further harm to
      Dunster now. Mrs. Fentolin was down in my room, and I thought it best to
      bring her back first before I even parleyed with them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be careful,&rdquo; she advised slowly. &ldquo;The man Dunster has been
      drugged, he has lost some of his will; he may have lost some of his mental
      balance. Mr. Fentolin is clever. He will find a dozen ways to wriggle out
      of any charge that can be brought against him. You know what he has really
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has kept back a document signed by the twelve men in America who
      control the whole of Wall Street, who control practically the money
      markets of the world. That document is a warning to Germany that they will
      have no war against England. Owing to Mr. Fentolin, it has not been
      delivered, and the Conference is sitting now. War may be declared at any
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as a matter of common sense,&rdquo; Hamel asked, &ldquo;why does Mr. Fentolin
      desire war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand Mr. Fentolin,&rdquo; she told him quietly. &ldquo;He is not
      like other men. There are some who live almost entirely for the sake of
      making others happy, who find joy in seeing people content and satisfied.
      Mr. Fentolin is the reverse of this. He has but one craving in life: to
      see pain in others. To see a human being suffer is to him a debauch of
      happiness. A war which laid this country waste would fill him with a
      delight which you could never understand. There are no normal human beings
      like this. It is a disease in the man, a disease which came upon him after
      his accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you have all been his slaves,&rdquo; Hamel said curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have all been his slaves,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;for different reasons.
      Before his accident came, Mr. Fentolin was my master and the only man in
      the world for me. After his accident, I think my feelings for him, if
      anything, grew stronger. I became his slave. I sold my conscience, my
      self-respect, everything in life worth having, to bring a smile to his
      lips, to help him through a single moment of his misery. And just lately
      the reaction has come. He has played with me just as he would sit and pull
      the legs out of a spider to watch its agony. I have been one of his
      favourite amusements. And even now, if he came into this room I think that
      I should be helpless. I should probably fall at his feet and pray for
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel looked at her wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come down to warn you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It is possible that this is
      the beginning of the end, that his wonderful fortune will desert him, that
      his star has gone down. But remember that he has the brains and courage of
      genius. You think that you have him in a trap. Don&rsquo;t be surprised, when
      you go back, to find that he has turned the tables upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Hamel declared. &ldquo;I looked all round the place. There isn&rsquo;t a
      window or opening anywhere. The trap-door is in the middle of the ceiling
      and it is fifteen feet from the floor. It shuts with a spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be as you say,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;It may be that he is safe.
      Remember, though, if you go near him, that he is desperate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where Miss Fentolin is?&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is with her mother,&rdquo; the woman replied, impatiently. &ldquo;She is coming
      down. Tell me, what are you going to do with Mr. Fentolin? Nothing else
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a friend,&rdquo; Hamel answered, &ldquo;who will see to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are relying upon the law,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think you will find that
      the law cannot touch him. Mr. Dunster was brought to the house in a
      perfectly natural manner. He was certainly injured, and injured in a
      railway accident. Doctor Sarson is a fully qualified surgeon, and he will
      declare that Mr. Dunster was unfit to travel. If necessary, they will have
      destroyed the man&rsquo;s intelligence. If you think that you have him broken,
      let me warn you that you may be disappointed. Let me, if I may, give you
      one word of advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; Hamel begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him coldly. Her tone was still free from any sort of
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken up some sort of position here,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;as a
      friend of Mrs. Seymour Fentolin, a friend of the family. Don&rsquo;t let them
      come back under the yoke. You know the secret of their bondage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been his slaves because their absolute obedience to his will
      was one of the conditions of his secrecy. He has drawn the cords too
      tight. Better let the truth be known, if needs be, than have their three
      lives broken. Don&rsquo;t let them go back under his governance. For me, I
      cannot tell. If he comes back, as he will come back, I may become his
      slave again, but let them break away. Listen&mdash;that is Mrs. Fentolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him. Hamel followed her out into the hall. Esther and her mother
      were already at the foot of the stairs. He drew them into the study.
      Esther gave him her hands, but she was trembling in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am terrified!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Every moment I think I can hear the
      click of that awful carriage. He will come back; I am sure he will come
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may,&rdquo; Hamel answered sturdily, &ldquo;but never to make you people his
      slaves again. You have done enough. You have earned your freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Mrs. Fentolin said firmly. &ldquo;We have gone on from sacrifice to
      sacrifice, until it has become a habit with us to consider him the master
      of our bodies and our souls. To-day, Esther, we have reached the breaking
      point. Not even for the sake of that message from the other side of the
      grave, not even to preserve his honour and his memory, can we do more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel held up his finger. He opened the French windows, and they followed
      him out on to the terrace. The grey dawn had broken now over the sea.
      There were gleams of fitful sunshine on the marshes. Some distance away a
      large motor-car was coming rapidly along the road.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster, lying flat upon his little bed, watched with dilated
      eyes the disappearance of the ladder. Then he laughed. It was a queer
      sound&mdash;broken, spasmodic, devoid of any of the ordinary elements of
      humor&mdash;and yet it was a laugh. Mr. Fentolin turned his head towards
      his prisoner and nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a constitution, my friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed, without any trace of
      disturbance in his voice. &ldquo;And what a sense of humour! Strange that a
      trifling circumstance like this should affect it. Meekins, burn some more
      of the powder. The atmosphere down here may be salubrious, but I am
      unaccustomed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster said in a hollow tone, &ldquo;you will have some
      opportunity now of discovering with me what it is like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too, is just possible,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted, blowing out a little
      volume of smoke from a cigarette which he had just lit, &ldquo;but one never
      knows. We have friends, and our position, although, I must admit, a little
      ridiculous, is easily remedied. But how that mischief-making Mr. Hamel
      could have found his way into the boat-house does, I must confess, perplex
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been hanging around and followed us in when we came,&rdquo;
       Meekins muttered. &ldquo;Somehow, I fancied I felt some one near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our young friend,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued, &ldquo;has, without doubt, an
      obvious turn of mind. He will send for his acquaintance in the Foreign
      Office; they will haul out Mr. Dunster here, and he will have a belated
      opportunity of delivering his message at The Hague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to murder me first, then?&rdquo; Mr. Dunster grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled at him benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear and valued guest,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;why so forbidding an idea? Let
      me assure you from the bottom of my heart that any bodily harm to you is
      the most unlikely thing in the world. You see, though you might not think
      it,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I love life. That is why I keep a doctor always by my
      side. That is why I insist upon his making a complete study of my
      constitution and treating me in every respect as though I were indeed an
      invalid. I am really only fifty-nine years old. It is my intention to live
      until I am eighty-nine. An offence against the law of the nature you
      indicate might interfere materially with my intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster struggled for a moment for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right, but do you suppose you won&rsquo;t be
      punished for what you&rsquo;ve done to me? You laid a deliberate plot to bring
      me to St. David&rsquo;s Hall; you&rsquo;ve kept me locked up, dosed me with drugs,
      brought me down here at the dead of night, kept me a prisoner in a
      dungeon. Do you think you can do that for nothing? Do you think you won&rsquo;t
      have to suffer for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Dunster,&rdquo; he reminded him, &ldquo;you were in a railway accident,
      you know; there is no possible doubt about that. And the wound in your
      head is still there, in a very dangerous place. Men who have been in
      railway accidents, and who have a gaping wound very close to their brain,
      are subject to delusions. I have simply done my best to play the Good
      Samaritan. Your clothes and papers are all untouched. If my eminent
      physician had pronounced you ready to travel a week ago, you would
      certainly have been allowed to depart a week ago. Any interference in your
      movements has been entirely in the interests of your health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster tried to sit up but found himself unable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think they won&rsquo;t believe my story, eh?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, we
      shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin thoughtfully contemplated the burning end of his cigarette
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I believed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there was any chance of your statements
      being accepted, I am afraid I should be compelled, in all our interests,
      to ask Doctor Sarson to pursue just a step further that experiment into
      the anatomy of your brain with which he has already trifled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s face was suddenly ghastly. His reserve of strength seemed to
      ebb away. The memory of some horrible moment seemed to hold him in its
      clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, leave me alone!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;Let me get away, that&rsquo;s all;
      let me crawl away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin murmured. &ldquo;That sounds much more reasonable. When you
      talk like that, my friend, I feel indeed that there is hope for you. Let
      us abandon this subject for the present. Have you solved the puzzle yet?&rdquo;
       he asked Meekins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meekins was standing below the closed trap-door. He had already dragged up
      a wooden case underneath and was piling it with various articles of
      furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;When I have made this steadier, I am just
      going to see what pressure I can bring to bear on the trap-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the bolts go,&rdquo; Doctor Sarson remarked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin declared, &ldquo;it will indeed be an interesting
      test of our friend Meekins&rsquo; boasted strength. Meekins holds his place&mdash;a
      very desirable place, too&mdash;chiefly for two reasons: first his
      discretion and secondly his muscles. He has never before had a real
      opportunity of testing the latter. We shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson came slowly and gravely to the bedside. He looked down upon
      his patient. Mr. Dunster shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure, sir,&rdquo; he said very softly, &ldquo;that Mr. Dunster, in his
      present state of mind, is a very safe person to be allowed his freedom. It
      is true that we have kept him here for his own sake, because of his fits
      of mental wandering. Our statements, however, may be doubted. An apparent
      return to sanity on his part may lend colour to his accusations,
      especially if permanent. Perhaps it would be as well to pursue that
      investigation a shade further. A touch more to the left and I do not think
      that Mr. Dunster will remember much in this world likely to affect us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s face was like marble. There were beads of perspiration upon
      his forehead, his eyes were filled with reminiscent horror. Mr. Fentolin
      bent over him with genuine interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a picture he would make!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;What a drama! Do you know, I
      am half inclined to agree with you, Sarson. The only trouble is that you
      have not your instruments here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could improvise something that would do the trick,&rdquo; the doctor said
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t a complicated affair. It seems to me that
      his story may gain credence from the very fact of our being discovered in
      this extraordinary place. To have moved him here was a mistake, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin admitted, with a sigh. &ldquo;It was our young friend
      Mr. Hamel who was responsible for it. I fancied him arriving with a search
      warrant at any moment. We will bear in mind your suggestion for a few
      minutes. Let us watch Meekins. This promises to be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By dint of piling together all the furniture in the place, the man was now
      able to reach the trap-door. He pressed upon it vigorously without even
      bending the wood. Mr. Fentolin smiled pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man turned and faced his master. His aspect of dogged civility had
      never been more apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin went on. &ldquo;I want to remind you of certain
      things, Meekins. We are among friends here&mdash;no secrecy, you
      understand, or anything of that sort. You need not be afraid! You know how
      you came to me? You remember that little affair of Anna Jayes in
      Hartlepool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the man was filled with terror. He began to tremble where he
      stood. Mr. Fentolin played for a moment with his collar, as though he
      found it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a chance it was, my dear Meekins,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin continued
      cheerfully, &ldquo;which brought me that little scrap of knowledge concerning
      you. It has bought me through all these years a good deal of faithful
      service. I am not ungrateful, believe me. I intend to retain you for my
      body-servant and to keep my lips sealed, for a great many years to come.
      Now remember what I have said. When we leave this place, that little
      episode will steal back into a far corner of my mind. I shall, in short,
      forget it. If we are caught here and inconvenience follows, well, I cannot
      say. Do your best, Meekins. Do a little better than your best. You have
      the reputation of being a strong man. Let us see you justify it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man took a long breath and returned to his task. His shoulders and
      arms were upon the door. He began to strain. He grew red in the face; the
      veins across his forehead stood out, blue, like tightly-drawn string. His
      complexion became purple. Through his open mouth his breath came in short
      pants. With every muscle of his body and neck he strained and strained.
      The woodwork gave a little, but it never even cracked. With a sob he
      suddenly almost collapsed. Mr. Fentolin looked at him, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good&mdash;very good, Meekins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not quite good enough.
      You are a trifle out of practice, perhaps. Take your breath, take time.
      Remember that you have another chance. I am not angry with you, Meekins. I
      know there are many enterprises upon which one does not succeed the first
      time. Get your breath; there is no hurry. Next time you try, see that you
      succeed. It is very important, Meekins, for you as well as for us, that
      you succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man turned doggedly back to his task. The eyes of the three men
      watched him&mdash;Mr. Dunster on the bed; Doctor Sarson, pale and gloomy,
      with something of fear in his dark eyes; and Mr. Fentolin himself, whose
      expression seemed to be one of purely benevolent and encouraging interest.
      Once more the face of the man became almost unrecognisable. There was a
      great crack, the trap-door had shifted. Meekins, with a little cry, reeled
      and sank backwards. Mr. Fentolin clapped his hands lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Meekins,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I do not know when I have enjoyed any
      performance so much. I feel as if I were back in the days of the Roman
      gladiators. I can see that you mean to succeed. You will succeed. You do
      not mean to end your days amid objectionable surroundings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the air of a man temporarily mad, Meekins went back to his task. He
      was sobbing to himself now. His clothes had burst away from him. Suddenly
      there was a crash, the hinges of the trap-door had parted. With the blood
      streaming from a wound in his forehead, Meekins staggered back to his
      feet. Mr. Fentolin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;Really excellent. With a little assistance
      from our friend Meekins, you, I am sure, Sarson, will now be able to climb
      up and let down the steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson stood by Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s chair, and together they looked up
      through the fragments of the trap-door. Meekins was still breathing
      heavily. Suddenly they heard the sound of a sharp report, as of a door
      above being slammed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one was in the boat-house when I broke the trap-door,&rdquo; Meekins
      muttered. &ldquo;I heard them moving about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us hurry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sarson, what about your patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster was lying upon his side, watching them. The doctor went over
      to the bedside and felt his pulse and head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do for twelve hours,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;If you think that other
      little operation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and looked at Mr. Fentolin meaningly. The man on the bed
      shrank back, his eyes lit with horror. Mr. Fentolin smiled pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we must not stay for that just now. A little
      later on, perhaps, if it becomes necessary. Let us first attend to the
      business on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins once more clambered on to the little heap of furniture. The doctor
      stood by his side for a moment. Then, with an effort, he was hoisted up
      until he could catch hold of the floor of the outhouse. Meekins gave one
      push, and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one up there?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin enquired, a shade of anxiety in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; the doctor reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything been disturbed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Sarson was some little time before he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;some one seems to have been rummaging about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send down the steps quickly,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin ordered. &ldquo;I am beginning to
      find the atmosphere here unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence. Then they heard the sound of the ladder being
      dragged across the floor, and a moment or two later it was carefully
      lowered and placed in position. Mr. Fentolin passed the rope through the
      front of his carriage and was drawn up. From his bed Mr. Dunster watched
      them go. It was hard to tell whether he was relieved or disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been in here?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin demanded, as he looked around the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. A grey twilight was struggling now through the high,
      dust-covered windows. Meekins, who had gone on towards the door, suddenly
      called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has taken away the key! The door is locked on the other side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s frown was malign even for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our dear friend, Mr. Hamel, I suppose,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Another little debt
      we shall owe him! Try the other door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins moved towards the partition. Suddenly he paused. Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s
      hand was outstretched; he, too, was listening. Above the low thunder of
      the sea came another sound, a sound which at that moment they none of them
      probably understood. There was the steady crashing of feet upon the
      pebbles, a low murmur of voices. Mr. Fentolin for the first time showed
      symptoms of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the other door quickly,&rdquo; he directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meekins came back, shaking his head. Outside, the noise seemed to be
      increasing. The door was suddenly thrown open. Hannah Cox stood outside in
      her plain black dress, her hair wind-tossed, her eyes aflame. She held the
      key in her fingers, and she looked in upon them. Her lips seemed to move,
      but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin exclaimed, frowning, &ldquo;are you the person who
      removed that key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand upon his chair. She took no notice of the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is something here I want you to listen to. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin, arrived outside on the stone front of the boat-house,
      pointed the wheel of his chair towards the Hall. Hannah Cox, who kept by
      his side, however, drew it gently towards the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down here,&rdquo; she directed softly. &ldquo;Bring your chair down the plank-way,
      close to the water&rsquo;s edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin exclaimed furiously, &ldquo;I am not in the humour
      for this sort of thing! Lock up, Sarson, at once; I am in a hurry to get
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will come just this little way,&rdquo; she continued, speaking without
      any change of tone. &ldquo;You see, the others are waiting, too. I have been
      down to the village and fetched them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin followed her outstretched finger and gave a sudden start.
      Standing at the edge of the sea were a dozen or twenty fishermen. They
      were all muttering together and looking at the top of the boat-house. As
      he realised the direction of their gaze, Mr. Fentolin&rsquo;s face underwent a
      strange transformation. He seemed to shrink in his chair. He was ghastly
      pale even to the lips. Slowly he turned his head. From a place in the roof
      of the boat-house a tall support had appeared. On the top was a swinging
      globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to do with that?&rdquo; he asked in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I felt that it was there. I have brought them
      up with me to see it. I think that they want to ask you some questions.
      But first, come and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shook her off. He looked around for Meekins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins, stand by my chair,&rdquo; he ordered sharply. &ldquo;Turn round; I wish to
      go to the Hall. Drive this woman away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meekins came hurrying up, but almost at the same moment half a dozen of
      the brown jerseyed fishermen detached themselves from the others. They
      formed a little bodyguard around the bath-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin demanded, his voice shrill
      with anger. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear what I said? This woman annoys me. Send her
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not one of the fishermen answered a word or made the slightest movement to
      obey him. One of them, a grey-bearded veteran, drew the chair a little
      further down the planked way across the pebbles. Hannah Cox kept close to
      its side. They came to a standstill only a few yards from where the waves
      were breaking. She lifted her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin turned helplessly around. The little group of fishermen had
      closed in upon Sarson and Meekins. The woman&rsquo;s hand was upon his shoulder;
      she pointed seaward to where a hissing line of white foam marked the spot
      where the topmost of the rocks were visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wondered why I have spent so much of my time out here,&rdquo; she said
      quietly. &ldquo;Now you will know. If you listen as I am listening, as I have
      listened for so many weary hours, so many weary years, you will hear them
      calling to me, David and John and Stephen. &lsquo;The light!&rsquo; Do you hear what
      they are crying? &lsquo;The light! Fentolin&rsquo;s light!&rsquo; Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She forced him to look once more at the top of the boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were right!&rdquo; she proclaimed, her voice gaining in strength and
      intensity. &ldquo;They were neither drunk nor reckless. They steered as straight
      as human hand could guide a tiller, for Fentolin&rsquo;s light! And there they
      are, calling and calling at the bottom of the sea&mdash;my three boys and
      my man. Do you know for whom they call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fentolin shrank back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this woman away!&rdquo; he ordered the fishermen. &ldquo;Do you hear? Take her
      away; she is mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked towards him, but not one of them moved. Mr. Fentolin raised
      his whistle to his lips, and blew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meekins!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where are you, Meekins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head and saw at once that Meekins was powerless. Five or six
      of the fishermen had gathered around him. There were at least thirty of
      them about, sinewy, powerful men. The only person who moved towards Mr.
      Fentolin&rsquo;s carriage was Jacob, the coast guardsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fentolin, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the lads have got your bully safe. It&rsquo;s a
      year and more that Hannah Cox has been about the village with some story
      about two lights on a stormy night. It&rsquo;s true what she says&mdash;that her
      man and boys lie drowned. There&rsquo;s William Green, besides, and a nephew of
      my own&mdash;John Kallender. And Philip Green&mdash;he was saved. He swore
      by all that was holy that he steered straight for the light when his boat
      struck, and that as he swam for shore, five minutes later, he saw the
      light reappear in another place. It&rsquo;s a strange story. What have you to
      say, sir, about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed straight to the wire-encircled globe which towered on its
      slender support above the boat-house. Mr. Fentolin looked at it and looked
      back at the coast guardsman. The brain of a Machiavelli could scarcely
      have invented a plausible reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light was never lit there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was simply to help me in
      some electrical experiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time in their lives, those who were looking on saw Mr.
      Fentolin apart from his carriage. Without any haste but with amazing
      strength, Hannah Cox leaned over, and, with her arms around his middle,
      lifted him sheer up into the air. She carried him, clasped in her arms, a
      weird, struggling object, to the clumsy boat that lay always at the top of
      the beach. She dropped him into the bottom, took her seat, and unshipped
      the oars. For one moment the coast guardsman hesitated; then he obeyed her
      look. He gave the boat a push which sent it grinding down the pebbles into
      the sea. The woman began to work at the oars. Every now and then she
      looked over her shoulder at that thin line of white surf which they were
      all the time approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, woman?&rdquo; Mr. Fentolin demanded hoarsely. &ldquo;Listen! It
      was an accident that your people were drowned. I&rsquo;ll give you an annuity.
      I&rsquo;ll make you rich for life&mdash;rich! Do you understand what that
      means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; she answered, looking down upon him as he lay doubled up at the
      bottom of the boat. &ldquo;I know what it means to be rich&mdash;better than
      you, maybe. Not to let the gold and silver pieces fall through your
      fingers, or to live in a great house and be waited upon by servants who
      desert you in the hour of need. That isn&rsquo;t being rich. It&rsquo;s rich to feel
      the touch of the one you love, to see the faces around of those you&rsquo;ve
      given birth to, to move on through the days and nights towards the end,
      with them around; not to know the chill loneliness of an empty life. I am
      a poor woman, Mr. Fentolin, and it&rsquo;s your hand that made me so, and not
      all the miracles that the Bible ever told of can make me rich again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;You can buy forgetfulness! The memory of
      everything passes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be a fool,&rdquo; she retorted grimly, &ldquo;and you the wise man; but this
      day we&rsquo;ll both know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little murmur from the shore, where the fishermen stood in a
      long line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him back, missus,&rdquo; Jacob called out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve scared him enough.
      Bring him back. We&rsquo;ll leave him to the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were close to the line of surf now; they had passed it, indeed, a
      little on the left, and the boat was drifting. She stood up, straight and
      stern, and her face, as she looked towards the land, was lit with the fire
      of the prophetess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll leave him to the law&mdash;to the law of God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they saw her stoop down, and once more with that almost superhuman
      strength which seemed to belong to her for those few moments, she lifted
      the strange object who lay cowering there, high above her head. From the
      shore they realised what was going to happen, and a great shout arose. She
      stood on the side of the boat and jumped, holding her burden tightly in
      her arms. So they went down and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen of the younger fishermen were in the water even before the
      grim spectacle was ended; another ran for a boat that was moored a little
      way down the beach. But from the first the search was useless. Only Jacob,
      who was a person afflicted with many superstitions, wiped the sweat from
      his forehead as he leaned over the bow of his boat and looked down into
      that fathomless space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her singing, her or her wraith,&rdquo; he swore afterwards. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
      forget the moment I looked down and down, and the water seemed to grow
      clearer, and I saw her walking there at the bottom among the rocks, with
      him over her back, singing as she went, looking everywhere for George and
      the boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if indeed his eyes were touched with fire at that moment, no one else
      in the world saw anything more of Miles Fentolin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. John P. Dunster removed the cigar from his teeth and gazed at the long
      white ash with the air of a connoisseur. He was stretched in a long chair,
      high up in the terraced gardens behind the Hall. At his feet were golden
      mats of yellow crocuses; long borders of hyacinths&mdash;pink and purple;
      beds of violets; a great lilac tree, with patches of blossom here and
      there forcing their way into a sunlit world. The sea was blue; the
      sheltered air where they sat was warm and perfumed. Mr. Dunster, who was
      occupying the position of a favoured guest, was feeling very much at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; he remarked meditatively, &ldquo;which I can&rsquo;t help
      thinking about you Britishers. You may deserve it or you may not, but you
      do have the most almighty luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheer envy,&rdquo; Hamel murmured. &ldquo;We escape from our tight corners by
      forethought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster declared vigorously. &ldquo;A year or less
      ago you got a North Sea scare, and on the strength of a merely honourable
      understanding with your neighbour, you risk your country&rsquo;s very existence
      for the sake of adding half a dozen battleships to your North Sea
      Squadron. The day the last of those battleships passed through the Straits
      of Gibraltar, this little Conference was plotted. I tell you they meant to
      make history there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was enough for everybody&mdash;India for Russia, a time-honoured
      dream, but why not? Alsace-Lorraine and perhaps Egypt, for France;
      Australia for Japan; China and South Africa for Germany. Why not? You may
      laugh at it on paper but I say again&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t quite come off, sir,&rdquo; Gerald observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster admitted, &ldquo;partly owing to you. There were only
      two things needed: France to consider her own big interests and to ignore
      an entente from which she gains nothing that was not assured to her under
      the new agreement, and the money. Strange,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster continued, &ldquo;how
      people forget that factor, and yet the man who was responsible for The
      Hague Conference knew it. We in the States are right outside all these
      little jealousies and wrangles that bring Europe, every now and then,
      right up to the gates of war, but I&rsquo;m hanged if there is one of you dare
      pass through those gates without a hand on our money markets. It&rsquo;s a new
      word in history, that little document, news of which Mr. Gerald here took
      to The Hague, the word of the money kings of the world. There is something
      that almost nips your breath in the idea that a dozen men, descended from
      the Lord knows whom, stopped a war which would have altered the whole face
      of history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was never any proof,&rdquo; Hamel remarked, &ldquo;that France would not have
      remained staunch to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not,&rdquo; Mr. Dunster agreed, &ldquo;but, on the other hand, your
      country had never the right to put such a burden upon her honour. Remember
      that side by side with those other considerations, a great statesman&rsquo;s
      first duty is to the people over whom he watches, not to study the
      interests of other lands. However, it&rsquo;s finished. The Hague Conference is
      broken up. The official organs of the world allude to it, if at all, as an
      unimportant gathering called together to discuss certain frontier
      questions with which England had nothing to do. But the memory of it will
      live. A good cold douche for you people, I should say, and I hope you&rsquo;ll
      take warning by it. Whatever the attitude of America as a nation may be to
      these matters, the American people don&rsquo;t want to see the old country in
      trouble. Gee whiz! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little cry from all of them. Only Hamel stood without sign of
      surprise, gazing downward with grim, set face. A dull roar, like the
      booming of a gun, flashes of fire, and a column of smoke&mdash;and all
      that was left of St. David&rsquo;s Tower was one tottering wall and a scattered
      mass of masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an idea,&rdquo; Hamel said quietly, &ldquo;that St. David&rsquo;s Tower was going to
      spoil the landscape for a good many years. My property, you know, and
      there&rsquo;s the end of it. I am sick of seeing people for the last few days
      come down and take photographs of it for every little rag that goes to
      press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dunster pointed out to the line of surf beyond. &ldquo;If only some hand,&rdquo;
       he remarked, &ldquo;could plant dynamite below that streak of white, so that the
      sea could disgorge its dead! They tell me there&rsquo;s a Spanish galleon there,
      and a Dutch warship, besides a score or more of fishing-boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin shivered a little. She drew her cloak around her. Gerald,
      who had been watching her, sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we chose the gardens for our last afternoon here,
      to be out of the way of these places! We&rsquo;ll go round the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fentolin shook her head once more. Her face had recovered its
      serenity. She looked downward gravely but with no sign of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to terrify us there, Gerald,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;The sea has
      gathered, and the sea will hold its own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamel held out his hand to Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have destroyed the only house in the world which I possess,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Come and look for violets with me in the spinney, and let us talk of the
      houses we are going to build, and the dreams we shall dream in them.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
